 * Two-state theme control: dark ↔ light.

 * Deliberately no "follow the system" state. One click turns it on, one click
 * turns it back, and the icon always names where the click goes — a third state
 * costs an extra click to return and shows an icon (a monitor) that reads as a
 * device rather than a theme. The trade is real and accepted: a viewer whose OS
 * is in night mode still starts on studio's own default rather than theirs.
 *
 * `showLabel` repeats that same destination as visible text inside the button, for
 * placements where an icon alone is not a control anyone finds — the mobile
 * overflow menu, where this is a settings row rather than one glyph among several
 * (#401). The text lives INSIDE the button on purpose: a caller that put its own
 * caption beside the toggle would leave that caption behind in the embedded case
 * below, labelling a control that is not there.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING when no `ThemeProvider` is mounted above it. That is the
 * embedded case: the host app owns the theme, `useTheme()` falls back to
 * next-themes' default context — whose `themes` array is empty — and a toggle
 * that cannot change anything is worse than no toggle at all.
