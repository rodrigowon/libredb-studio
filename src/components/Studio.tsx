    What the two standalone AI entry points do now (#331 T3). The in-editor chat is
    gone; the command palette's item and the mobile header's button open the RAIL on
    the statement the editor is holding. Both go through this one handler, because a
    decision made at each caller is a decision made twice.

    The workflow is INVESTIGATION, not query-optimization, and that is deliberate.
    The control being replaced was a general assistant, not an optimizer, so choosing
    the optimizer would commit the user to a goal they never asked for: that
    workflow's verifier requires the run to PROPOSE a change and back it with a plan
    it read — a comparison, or an index citing the plan it diagnosed
    (`src/lib/agent/goal-verifier.ts`) — and a run that perfectly explained what the
    statement does proposes nothing, so it would still be recorded as "did not
    answer". The workflow control is one click away in the rail, and investigation is
    the general one.

    The objective is the statement and nothing composed around it. Writing prose like
    "why is this slow?" on the user's behalf would put words in a box that is theirs
    and stays editable. It is read from the tab this shell already owns rather than
    from the editor handle: `QueryEditor`'s `onContentChange` writes every keystroke
    into that tab through `updateTabById` (see the mount below), and `use-tab-manager`
    derives `currentTab` from the tabs it writes to — so the tab is current, and
    `getEditorValue` was the AI hook's private callback rather than a second source of
    truth. The seam bounds the length; nothing here has to.

    An empty editor mints no ask. An objective saying nothing would still be recorded
    as APPLIED by the rail, so it would clear a standing offer and overwrite nothing
    to no purpose. The entry point still opens the rail — which below `md` means
    opening the sheet here, since the seam only opens it when it has an ask to apply,
    and above `md` means nothing at all: the rail is already the panel, and arming the
    sheet flag there would pop a sheet open the first time the window narrows.
  */
  /*
    The statement is passed as the user wrote it, minus the whitespace around it. That
    trim is not a liberty taken with their text: the rail sends `objective.trim()` when
    Start is pressed, so anything this kept would be dropped a moment later anyway, and
    keeping it would only spend the seam's length budget on blanks. What is deliberately
    NOT done is composing anything around the statement — no "Why is this query slow?"

          The agent rail. Absent — not hidden, not disabled — while the server says
          the runtime is off, which is the default. One instance serves both
          presentations: this panel above `md`, and a sheet below it, where the panel
          is display:none and the mobile nav is what opens the rail.

          The imports above are static, so with the flag off the rail's modules and the
          two hydration modules beside them are still in the standalone bundle — as is
          `execution-policy.ts`,
          which the rail and the timeline import as VALUES for the budget meter's
          ceilings. What does NOT reach a browser is any agent RUNTIME module (the
          ledger, the run service, the tool layer, the model adapter — those are
          server-only and the rail imports nothing from them but types), and no agent
          request is made beyond the discovery probe. `docs/AGENT.md` states the same
          boundary for a reader who never opens this file.
          This repository lazy-imports libraries but no COMPONENT
          (neither `next/dynamic` nor `React.lazy` appears under `src/`), and the
          package boundary — the one that matters for what ships to platform — is
          pinned separately in T12.
