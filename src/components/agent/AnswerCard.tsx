/**
 * The run's outcome, at the top of the rail (the agent rail UX redesign of 2026-08-21).
 *
 * It is a SECOND rendering of entries the timeline already holds, and that is the whole
 * shape of it: everything on this card is folded out of the run's ledger, so there is no
 * field here a run did not record and no sentence about a run that is not already the
 * app's own words somewhere else. The transcript below still holds the chronology; this
 * says what came of it, without a scroll.
 *
 * Three properties are correctness rather than layout, and each is pinned by a test:
 *
 *  - **`Apply to editor` keeps the accessible name `applyStatementName` builds.** That
 *    name is WCAG 2.5.3 and it carries the guard's marks — the one thing a control which
 *    can put a `DELETE` in the user's editor may not lose by being moved.
 *  - **On an engine whose statements are not SQL there is no read-only chip.** Nothing
 *    examined the draft, so a chip saying it was read would be a claim no code in this
 *    product made. It gets the amber `not checked` chip and the two existing sentences
 *    instead.
 *  - **A statement is tinted by the engine's language**, the ladder `tab-language.ts`
 *    walks. Where no capabilities are to hand it falls back to what the LEDGER says the
 *    guard could read, never to SQL: a Mongo aggregation painted as SQL is the same
 *    overstatement #414 removed from the sentences beside it.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is offer a control for something this build cannot
 * perform. A refusal names no "capture more schema" button and a failure's retry appears
 * only where the host passed one, the rule the rest of this rail follows: nothing here is
 * a disabled button standing in for a capability that does not exist.

 * ledger instead of from this function is a second, independent reading of the same
 * question — and two readings of one question is how the rail came to withhold the only
 * `Apply to editor` a run had while the card was showing something else entirely.
 *
 * The run's PRODUCT decides, and the status does not:
 *
 *  - whatever the ledger holds as the deliverable comes first, before the status,
 *    deliberately. A stream chunk can carry `answer-composed` and `run-finished`
 *    together, and it can also carry an answer while the run is still finishing; an
 *    answer gated on a terminal status would not be rendered in the first case at all,
 *    which is the trap the rail's own artifact delivery already records.
 *  - and `failed` is a status, not the absence of a product. `conclude` in
 *    `src/lib/agent/investigation.ts` records the closing prose and then the drafted
 *    statement BEFORE `service.finish`, and it is called with `"failed"` for a model
 *    timeout, an exhausted deadline and the turn ceiling — so a plan run that fenced a
 *    statement and then ran out of turns ends `failed` HOLDING its deliverable, and
 *    `run-finished`'s own documentation names the combination. Reading the status first
 *    replaced the statement, the marked hand-off, the guard's claims and the chips with
 *    a banner, on the one surface the marking rules exist for. The failure is stated
 *    beside the product instead (`FailureNote`), which loses nothing: the pill already
 *    prints `failed`.
 *
 * `"running"` is what is left when the ledger holds no product yet, and `null` is a run
 * with nothing recorded, or one that ended having produced nothing. Neither gets a card:
 * the transcript says what happened, and a card would have to invent a headline for it.
