/**
 * Fetches one result a run stored, for the shell to hydrate (#329 T11).
 *
 * It lives beside the rail but is used by the SHELL, and that is the point: the rail
 * decides what a user may ask for, the shell owns the surfaces that render results,
 * and the request between them belongs to neither component's render. Nothing here
 * runs on its own — `show` is called from a user action and from nowhere else.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *
 *  - **It does not retry.** A run's results live in process memory and are released
 *    when the run ends, so a refusal is usually final rather than transient, and
 *    asking again would only repeat it.
 *  - **It keeps no history.** One artifact is shown at a time; asking for another
 *    replaces it, and dismissing leaves the tab exactly as it was, because the tab's
 *    own result was never touched.
