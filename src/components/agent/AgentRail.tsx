 *  - **A connection the server could not rebuild cannot be investigated.** A run
 *    persists a connection id and no credential, so a process resuming it re-resolves
 *    the connection server-side; settings living only in this browser could never be
 *    rebuilt there. Which connections qualify is decided before the rail sees them
 *    (`resolveAgentRunConnectionId`); the rail says so instead of posting a request
 *    that can only be refused.
 *
 * One instance serves both presentations. Above `md` it renders in the panel Studio
 * gives it; below `md` that panel is `display:none` and the same content is hosted

 * rendering of this entry is precisely the arrangement that could have reintroduced it.

    on the same shortcut are two asks, and a request compared by value would make the
    second one a prop that did not change.

    Whether the sheet must be opened is decided HERE, from the viewport itself
    (`isMobileViewport`) rather than from `useIsMobile`. This effect runs after commit
    and only on the client, so the platform's answer is exact at the moment the ask is
    served. The hook answers exactly too since it moved to `useSyncExternalStore`, but
    what it hands back is the value of the render this effect closed over, not the
    platform's answer at the instant the effect runs. Opening the sheet is a decision
    taken once, at that instant, so it asks the platform rather than the render.

    That replaced a ref recording an "owed" open, paid the next time the hook reported
    mobile. The T1 adversarial recheck showed it carried two defects (R1, R2): on a
    real desktop the hook's value never changed, so the debt was never discharged and
    the first narrowing of the window opened the sheet for an ask the user had already
    been served in the panel — the exact thing that code's comment claimed could not
    happen — and the debt was keyed to the REQUEST rather than to the open it owed.
    Reading the viewport directly leaves nothing to owe and nothing to pay later, so
    both defects are gone rather than guarded.

    Nothing here starts a run. That is the seam's rule rather than an omission — a

    Opening the run, once every decision it carries has been made.

    Both axes are always sent. They are independent (#325): a planning run of a query
    optimization is an ordinary thing to ask for, and sending the workflow only in
    agent mode made the rail unable to express one. `workflowSource` goes with them
    because the surface owes the user a different sentence in each case, and the run
    record is the only place that survives a reload.

    The hand-over setting is resolved through `canHandOver` one last time rather than
    taken from the tick alone: the host's runner can move between the consent step and
    this call, and `true` on a run that cannot present an answer is refused outright by
    the route. The mode axis cannot move — it is frozen from the click that started this
    sequence until the run opens or the user abandons it (see the mode buttons below) —
    because this function is the closure of the render the click happened in, and a mode
    switched underneath it would open a run in one mode while the rail showed the other.

    A run being REPLACED is stopped here, at the moment its replacement is actually
    being opened, and not at the click that chose the new workflow. That click may still
    be abandoned at the consent step, and a cancellation fired there would end the open
    run for a replacement that never arrives — with the objective box already emptied,
    leaving the user nothing to re-ask with. `run.cancel()` is the same ask the Stop
    control makes, awaited so the DELETE is sent before `start` aborts the controller
    that carries it.

    **And the replacement is opened only if that stop was ACCEPTED.** The ask can be
    refused — the run may be gone, the server may answer 5xx, the request may never
    arrive — and awaiting it establishes only that it was made. Opening anyway left the
    original run executing beside its replacement, on the same connection, spending its
    own budget, with the rail following the new one and nothing on screen saying the old
    one was still going: the copy beside "change" promises a cancel-and-replace, and this
    is what keeps that promise rather than describing it. A stop that failed opens
    nothing and says so (`replaceFailed`), which leaves the user the run they had and the
    control that offers to try again.

    Every value it acts on comes off `decided`, including the connection: this function
    is the closure of the render its `hold` happened in on one path and is called from

    It is cleared when the SERVER HAS OPENED the run — the moment a run id exists —
    rather than on the click. A start can be refused (a model the capability gate
    turned down, a connection that no longer resolves, a request that never arrived),
    and a surface that ate the user's sentence on the way to a refusal would make them
    type it again to retry. `run.runId` is null until the server answered, so a start
    that did not happen costs nothing.

    Nothing is lost by one that did, either: the objective is on the run's own header
    and the timeline's first entry quotes it, so the question stays readable beside the
    run answering it.

    It is adjusted DURING render against the run id the box was last emptied for, which

    an effect that would commit one frame still holding the previous question and then

    chart. Driven live twice on 2026-08-15, both runs reached `answer-composed` with a
    valid chart spec and NEITHER chart was ever displayed: by the time a user reads the
    answer the run has ended, its rows are released with it, and the control that would
    have opened them is gone. The product composed the answer and showed the user a
    sentence saying it had.

    So the answer is delivered here, at the moment its entry arrives, while the rows
    the run read still exist. Once per entry and cleared on the run id, which is the
    hand-over's own pattern above and for the same two reasons: a fold runs on every
    appended line, and entry ids are positional within one run, so the next run reuses
    them.

    is executed here: the rows are ones this run already read on its own bounded
    read-only path, and showing them is the run delivering what it was asked for.

    It is keyed to the ENTRY, deliberately not to `showArtifact` above, which is
    withheld once the run is no longer live. A stream chunk can carry `answer-composed`
    and `run-finished` together, and the fold then reports a finished run in the very
    render that first sees the answer — so a delivery gated on the status would never
    fire in exactly the case that was measured. Nothing about retention changes: the
    rows are not kept a moment longer, they are shown while they are there.

    A host with no `onShowArtifact` is left alone and nothing is recorded as delivered,

    the rail sending a user from one failure into a quieter one.

    `missing` cannot tell those apart: it names streaming in that case AND in the case

    `gemma3:270m` refusal, whose model then completed a planning run. `disproved` is the
    half that can, so the offer hangs on it: withdrawn only where the probe WATCHED the

    Keeping the newest entry in view (#373 review).

    Measured on a completed run: the container sat at `scrollTop: 0` with a
    `scrollHeight` of 760 against a `clientHeight` of 360, so the report — the thing
    the user was waiting for — was 400 pixels below the fold and had to be dragged to.
    A timeline nobody can see the end of is a timeline that reports nothing.

    Following is a STATE, not something that happens to every append: a user who
    scrolled up to read an earlier step must not be yanked back down by the next
    entry. They leave it by scrolling away and return to it by scrolling back, which
    is what makes it a rule rather than a fight over the scrollbar. It starts true,
    because a run that has produced nothing yet is already at its own end.

    `scrollHeight - clientHeight` rather than `scrollHeight`: a browser clamps the
    latter to the same value, and writing what is meant is what lets the position be
    asserted rather than inferred.

    An entry arriving is not the only thing that moves the bottom, and driving the
    merged branch is what proved it. A finished analysis run sat at `scrollTop: 245` of
    a 1090-pixel column — 637 pixels short — with every entry already delivered. The
    container had not grown; it had SHRUNK. Showing the run's answer opens the host's
    result panel, the rail's own viewport goes from 360 pixels to 208, and the bottom
    moves out from under a position that was correct when it was set. No entry arrives
    to say so, so an effect keyed on the entries alone has nothing to re-run on.

    Hence the observer: it is the resize, not the append, that this has to survive, and
    a `ResizeObserver` sees both — the container's own box and the content growing
    inside it. The entry effect stays because it is the cheaper path for the common
    case and it is what the eight tests below pin.

    Following the newest entry is right while there IS a newest entry to follow, and
    wrong the moment there is not (L1, measured in Chrome on 2026-08-21).

    Immediately after each run reached a terminal status, with nobody having scrolled,
    the container sat at its own maximum — 224 of 224 on the plan run, 248 of 248 on the
    agent run — and the answer card, which is the first child of this container, was that
    far above the fold. The newest entry at that point is `run-finished`; the thing the
    user has been waiting for is at the top. Every run therefore ended by landing the
    reader at the bottom of the transcript, which defeats the one thing this redesign is
    for.

    So the run's own status bounds the following, and the end of the run brings the
    answer into view instead — once per run, because it is an event and not a position to
    hold: a reader who then scrolls down into the transcript must not be pulled back up
    by the next resize. And it is still subject to the standing rule that a reader who
    scrolled away is left where they are; the reveal is for the reader who was watching
    the run, not for the one reading step four.

    The card stays INSIDE the scroller. Lifting it out would give the answer a fixed
    share of a 384-pixel panel — a long report would then starve the transcript, or need
    a scroller of its own inside the one it sits above — and it would sit over the

    What reaches the database, from `posture.ts` and from nowhere else — the whole reason
    that module exists is that the rail used to answer this question in six places and a
    user comparing two of them could not tell which one bounded the run.

    ONE module, asked TWO questions, because with a run open they stop having the same
    answer:

     - **what the open run does**, which the strip under the header says. Both of its axes
       come off the run. The mode is the run's own ledger (`AgentRunTimeline.mode`), not
       the toggle: the toggle is frozen only while a start is HELD, deliberately, since it
       decides the NEXT run, so reading it here let one click on Plan relabel a run that
       was executing reads as "Executes nothing it drafts". The hand-over is what the open
       REQUEST carried, and `openedWithHandover` is never cleared — it is a record, not a
       live reading — so it is gated on the run still being open, or the strip goes on
       promising one statement in the editor after the widened run has ended, while the
       next consent step defaults the tick to OFF.
     - **what pressing Start would do**, which the amber engine notice is entirely about.
       That one is the SELECTION's: the notice renders on the selected mode and offers the
       way out of that selection, so reading the open run's posture there would put plan
       mode's body inside a card whose whole subject is the engine agent mode cannot
       execute on. A muted line under Start used to ask the same question in words, and it
       said the strip's sentence over again 200px below it (L7), so it is gone.

    The two coincide whenever no run is open, which is most of the panel's life.

    Both axes of the open run's posture ask `runOpen` FIRST, and read the run before they

    The asymmetry they replaced is what made a defect: the hand-over used to ask
    `pendingStart` first, so a consent step standing for the NEXT run outranked the run
    that was open — and the two coexist by design ("change" raises the step over a live
    run, and stops nothing until it is accepted; a stream that ended without a terminal
    entry clears `isBusy` with the status still `running`, which puts Start back within
    reach). The strip then relabelled an executing run from a checkbox belonging to a run
    nobody had opened: un-widened while the widened one was still handing statements over,
    and widened while the open one may hand nothing over. Keep the order aligned, in both
    lines, or that class of defect comes back on the next edit.

    two disagreed on a run that ended `failed` holding a product — the card rendered a

    One reading, asked in one place, cannot disagree with itself.

     - `agent`: the card renders that answer's `applySql` through `HydrationControls` in

       "Apply to editor" for one statement — and a user who clicks the lower one has no

          There is no second posture line under Start (L7, measured 2026-08-21).

          It printed `${headline} — ${qualifier}.`, which is the strip's own sentence,
          about 200px below the strip: two identical sentences in one 384px panel, and the
          lower one was the easier to mistake for a claim about something else. The strip
          is permanent and always visible, so what the line said is not lost — and the

          one that says something the strip does not, because it is about a mode the user
          has selected and the engine cannot execute.

          The alternative considered was to give this line the login hero's claim
          (`hero-proof.tsx`), which IS different information. It was not taken: that claim
          describes both modes at once, for a visitor who has selected neither, and here
          one is selected — and reusing it would mean exporting the hero's private
          `AGENT_MODES` out of a module that also pulls in the distribution and showcase
          catalogs, for a sentence about the mode the user did not pick.
        */}

        {/*
          The refused model (#331 T4). A start refused because the model was ESTABLISHED
          as unable to drive an agent run is not the generic red line: nothing here can
          be retried, and what has to change is not in this panel at all.

          #325 ratified that such a model "falls back explicitly to chat/NL2SQL". T2 and
          T3 removed both of those surfaces, so that decision is void — but the earlier
          reading of this state, that nothing toolless survived them, was FALSE, and the
          rail said so to users. The toolless surface that survived is this rail's own
          planning mode, one click away, in this panel. Driven live on 2026-08-13 — an
          `ollama` endpoint serving `gemma3:270m` refused the agent start below, and the
          same model then ran a planning run to `succeeded`.

          That `admitAgentModel` admits planning without probing is why the mode is
          REACHABLE with a refused model; it is not evidence that it WORKS with one. The
          gate skips the probe because planning needs no tools, which answers nothing
          about whether this endpoint would serve a toolless request — see
          `planModeOffered` above for the one observation that settles it the other way.

          So the state says what is true instead. An AGENT run is what this model cannot
          drive, and why; plan mode is offered where nothing the probe saw rules it out;
          a different model is what buys a run that reads the database. The offer only
          SELECTS the mode — the user decides whether to ask anything of it, the same
          rule T1's shortcut follows, and for the same reason: a click that spent model
          budget would be a different feature.

          Three registers, on purpose. The verdict is a heading; the shortfall is the
          structured `missing` rendered AS structure, one item per capability, so it can
          be scanned rather than read; the report is the server's prose, the only place
          the model's name and the endpoint's own words appear. The shortfall and the
          report do name the same capabilities — driven live on 2026-08-13, that reads as
          a summary above its detail, and the alternative is a browser that either parses
          the server's sentence apart or renders `missing` decoratively.

          The small print is `text-fg-tertiary` rather than `text-fg-muted`, which computes
          to 3.98:1 on this panel's `#0a0a0a` under the alert's own tint — short of WCAG
          AA at a size the large-text allowance does not cover (#100, #331 T4 review).

        It reports what the server ENFORCES and reads every consumption off the run's own

        they are, because nothing durable records their consumption — the wall-clock

        What changed is where the reading SITS, and nothing about what it says. Four
        stacked paragraphs of caveat above the transcript pushed the run's own output below
        the fold on every viewport this rail ships in, so the block is a `<details>`: the

        one on the figure it qualifies, each one still rendered in full, and each one still
        in the accessibility tree whether or not its popover is open (`InfoNote`). Their
        test ids travel with them, because they are the claims and not the layout.

          What came of the run, above the chronology of it (item 2 of the redesign).

          It is a SECOND rendering of entries the timeline below already holds, and it is
          first in this container rather than pinned outside it deliberately: the answer
          scrolls away like everything else, so a user reading the transcript is not
          reading it under a fixed block that has taken a third of the panel.

          No `capabilities`: this rail is given a connection id and a type, not a provider
          descriptor, and there is no fetch here to get one — every test in this suite
          counts the requests this component makes. The card's fallback is the honest one
          for that state: it tints from what the LEDGER says the guard could read, and
          answers "unknown" rather than SQL where nothing said.

          The run's grounding is not passed either, and deliberately: the card reads the
          capture off this same timeline. It used to be a second prop beside it, and a
          claim a caller can forget to pass is a claim that disappears — on MongoDB the
          answer showed the amber `not checked` chip alone while the fold two lines below
          said `Schema captured — 5 collections` (L4, measured 2026-08-21).

          `onStop` is deliberately not passed. The run's stop is one control and it is the
          one in the row above, three lines up: a second Stop inside the card would be two
          buttons for one ask, and the header's is the one this rail has always offered —
          including in the window between an accepted start and its first ledger line,
          where there is no card yet at all.

          It was not a duplicate by accident: the card renders the same claims, quoted the
          same way, with the same citations — so the rail printed the model's claim twice
          and offered "Apply to editor" three times for one statement, the card's, this
          section's citation and the `Statement drafted` entry that recorded it. Not one of
          the three carried an accessible name.

          Nothing this section said is gone. The claims are `agent-answer-claim`, quoted
          exactly as they were and still never narrated as the app speaking; each
          citation's label, the ledger's own detail for it and the statement it rests on
          are in the card's `agent-answer-evidence` fold, with the locator on the chip
          beside the claim; and a citation this timeline holds no entry for still says so
          in its own words rather than looking checked. Its `Show result` is the one thing
          not reproduced there, and it was already a second offer of the artifact the
          `Result stored` entry offers under the same live-run rule — while the note above
          is what explains the absence once a run has ended.
