 * duplicated is a place where a surface can come to say something the run never

 * The name a screen reader, a voice user and a tooltip all get for the one control

 * what they can see, so "Apply to editor" has to be inside whatever this returns.
 * Everything after it is the part a colour cannot carry.
 *
 * Both warnings are stated in the terms the server established and no stronger, and the
 * first of them was once stated a good deal stronger. It read "This statement is not a
 * read: applying it puts SQL in your editor that can change or delete data", which is a
 * claim about the statement's EFFECT that `readOnly` cannot support: it is
 * `inspectAgentStatement(sql) === null`, and four of that guard's six objections say
 * only that it could not read the text — an unclosed span, a run two dialects disagree
 * about, a second statement, no statement at all — while its own header records that it
 * over-refuses legitimate reads on purpose. A jsonb read using `#>>` would have been
 * announced to a screen-reader user as SQL that can delete their data. So the name says
 * what the guard did, and the reason travels with it.
 *
 * The identifier finding is about names the captured inventory does not hold, which is
 * a reason the statement may not run rather than proof that it will not.
 *
 * `null` is the AGENT path, where there is no draft view to read: the run wrote that
 * statement, executed it on the read-only session the engine enforced and answered from
 * the rows, so the ledger holds no guard reading about it and this returns the visible
 * label alone. A mark there would have to be invented, which is the one thing the
 * paragraphs above refuse — and the name is still built HERE, because "every hand-off
 * the answer card offers is named by this function" is the property that keeps a control
 * from shipping unnamed the way all three of them had (L6).
