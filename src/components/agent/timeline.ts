/**
 * One run's ledger, turned into the timeline a user reads (#329 T10a).
 *
 * Types only from the runtime modules: this file runs in the browser, and the
 * modules that define these contracts reach the durable backend and the database
 * drivers. `import type` erases, so the rail carries the vocabulary without
 * carrying the runtime (the boundary T12 pins mechanically).
 *
 * Two properties of the translation are deliberate and tested:
 *
 *  - **Wording the app chose and text that came from elsewhere never share a
 *    field.** `headline`/`detail` are this repository's own words; `quoted` is
 *    verbatim content from the model, the engine or the user, and the rail renders
 *    it as a quoted block. Database content is untrusted input — the same rule the
 *    prompts follow — so it is never spliced into a sentence the user would read as
 *    the app speaking.
 *  - **A policy denial reads as a denial.** It is reported by its deny code, and
 *    there is no engine text to show because the refusal type carries none (T2).
 *    A database error is the only variant with a message, and that message is
 *    `quoted`, not narrated.
 *
 * THREE value imports from the runtime modules, and all three are deliberate (#329
 * T10b, the per-workflow ceilings, and #414): `execution-policy.ts`, because the
 * budget meter's ceilings have to be the numbers the server actually enforces rather
 * than a second copy that can drift from them; `DEFAULT_AGENT_WORKFLOW_TYPE` from
 * `types.ts`, because a header written before the workflow field must fold to the same
 * workflow the server reads it as; and `TABLE_INVENTORY_NOUN` from
 * `inventory-noun.ts`, because a ledger written before the noun existed must fold to
 * the word it was written under, and spelling "table"/"tables" a second time here is
 * exactly the drift that default exists to prevent. All three modules are frozen
 * constants and type declarations whose own imports are types only, so none of them
 * puts anything in the browser bundle — the property `plan-draft-boundary.test.ts`
 * measures, and the one a directly-inspected import list once got wrong.

/**
 * Folds a ledger into what the rail renders. The status comes from the ledger and

 * same thing as a run reported to the process that resumes it.
 *
 * The budget is counted the same way, and the counting rules are the enforcement
 * layer's rather than this file's inventions:
 *
 *  - A statement is charged once per execution the pipeline ALLOWED and invoked.
 *    `execution.ts` charges `statements: 1` on the success path and on the failure
 *    path alike, so a completed read and an engine error each cost one. Note that
 *    this is wider than "reached the database": `tools.ts` acquires the provider
 *    inside the allowed callback on purpose, so an acquisition failure is accounted
 *    as a spent statement although nothing ran — and it settles no step, so this
 *    fold cannot see it either.
 *  - A policy denial and an approval requirement charge nothing at all:
 *    `execution.ts` returns before `tracker.beginExecution` on any non-allow, and
 *    `AgentRepairLedger` consumes a repair attempt only for a database error.
 *  - A refused operational reading charges a STATEMENT and no repair. It is decided
 *    inside the invoke callback, after the pipeline allowed the call and
 *    `beginExecution` ran, so the tracker has already counted it; and no rewording
 *    could have changed the answer, so the repair ledger does not.
 *  - A schema capture contributes the statements and the span the TRACKER charged it,
 *    read off its own entry (B13). Its reads settle no step and write no
 *    `tool-completed`, so before that measurement was recorded a run whose first two or
 *    three statements were catalog reads folded to zero.
 *  - Database time is the elapsed time each CHARGED statement recorded: a completed
 *    read's own `summary.elapsedMs`, and, for the two refusal classes the tracker
 *    charged, the span it charged them (#512). An entry carrying no
 *    duration — every refusal written before that field existed — contributes nothing
 *    rather than a zero, and is counted into `statementsWithoutDuration` so the rail
 *    can name what the figure is missing instead of presenting an invented one (#477).
 *
 * Every figure this produces is therefore a FLOOR on what the run has spent, and
 * the rail says so rather than presenting it as exact. Two of the three ways B13
 * recorded the ledger as narrower than the tracker remain: an acquisition failure is
 * charged a statement and settles no step, so nothing here can see it; and a completed
 * read reports the engine's own elapsed time while the tracker charges the span around
 * the whole call. The third — the schema capture's charged reads — is folded above from
 * the measurement the capture now records, which leaves a ledger written before that
 * field as the case where a capture still contributes nothing. The list is what is
 * KNOWN, not a proof that nothing else is missing.

  /*
    What a plan run's closing entry IS, decided after the walk rather than during it
    (item 7 of the plan-mode SQL-generator design of 2026-08-15). Two outcomes, and
    the ledger's statement event settles which:

     - it recorded one, so this prose is the text that statement was read out of. The
       entry is flagged, and the surface stops offering the blocks inside it through a
       control that cannot say what it is applying — the card below does that with the
       mark on it.
     - it recorded none, so the run may have taken its other legitimate ending and
       said `NO STATEMENT:`.

    Afterwards because both decisions need the whole ledger: the statement event is
    written immediately AFTER the closing statement it was read out of, so neither is
    knowable at the moment that entry is folded. And they need the run's MODE, because
    only a plan run's contract gives either fact any meaning — an agent run's closing
    prose was never asked for the token and never has a card beneath it.

    The ledger decides, and this pass only presents: where the server recorded a
    statement nothing is re-read, so the fence-aware reader on the server and the
    line-wise one here cannot end up describing the same run differently.
