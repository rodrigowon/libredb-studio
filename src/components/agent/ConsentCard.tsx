/**
 * The consent step (§2.6 of `docs/AGENT_ANALYST_DESIGN.md`, and §"Why the consent step is
 * placed there"), lifted out of `AgentRail.tsx` unchanged in what it decides.
 *
 * It replaced the pre-start checkbox entirely. That checkbox rendered wherever the workflow
 * happened to be `data-analysis`, which is a state the user could leave without the tick
 * leaving with them — and, before #373, a state four workflows could reach at all. Consent
 * asked HERE cannot drift from the run it is about: the workflow is already decided, and the
 * very next thing that happens is the request that opens the run with it.
 *
 * It is still consent given at OPEN time, which is what `src/lib/agent/types.ts` requires of
 * every widening decision: no run exists yet.
 *
 * **The copy is the control.** "Auto-mode" transfers no responsibility because it names no
 * bound, so this names all three — the bound the run keeps for its own read, the bound the
 * editor keeps, and the bound being given up — and says what the run does INSTEAD when its
 * gate declines, because a user who finds the statement sitting unrun has to be able to read
 * that as the feature working. Every figure comes from the constants the enforcement reads.
 *
 * What the redesign changed is the ORDER those facts are read in, and nothing else. The old
 * card opened with a ninety-word paragraph, so the two things a user needs first — the tick
 * is off, and the run is read-only either way — arrived last if they arrived at all. Here the
 * heading states the default, the label carries the decision, and the paragraph moves into a
 * popover on that label. It moves WITHOUT leaving the accessibility tree: it is still the
 * checkbox's `aria-describedby` target, always rendered, hidden from sight alone. A
 * description that exists only while a popover is open is a description a screen-reader user
 * is never given, which would trade one audience's clarity for another's.
