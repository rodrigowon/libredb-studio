/**
 * The standing safety strip: one always-visible row under the rail header saying what the
 * SELECTED MODE does to the database.
 *
 * It renders `src/lib/agent/posture.ts` and decides nothing. That split is the point — the
 * posture module owns every claim and every derived figure, this component owns the palette
 * and the popover — so a restyle here cannot change what the rail asserts, and a change to
 * `AGENT_EXECUTION_ENGINES` or to a policy row reaches this surface without a class being
 * touched. Nothing below writes a sentence of its own; grep this file for a full stop
 * outside a comment and you will not find one.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and each is one edit away from being lost:
 *
 *  - **The qualifier sits BESIDE the pill, never behind the ⓘ.** A bare "Executes nothing
 *    it drafts" overclaims: on the dialects `CATALOG_PLANS` serves, plan mode's grounding
 *    capture IS a catalog read, and `engine-support.ts` says in its own header that copy
 *    compressing these facts overclaims. Both halves are on one line, and the row
 *    flex-WRAPS rather than truncating, because a qualifier cut off mid-clause is the same
 *    overclaim with an ellipsis on the end.
 *  - **The full claim reaches assistive technology whether or not the popover is open.**
 *    The claim node is rendered always — `sr-only` while shut, a card while open — and it
 *    is the strip's `aria-describedby` target either way. One node and not two, so the
 *    text a screen-reader user gets and the text a sighted user opens cannot become two
 *    versions of the same claim.
 *  - **The ⓘ is a real `<button>`, tied to no preference.** It is the only route to the
 *    body, so it is not decoration and it is not optional: the platform gives it Enter,
 *    Space, focus and a tab stop, which a `<span>` with an `onClick` gives none of.
 *    Escape shuts it and returns focus, because a popover a keyboard user can open and not
 *    close is one that traps their reading position.
 *
 * The connection name is NOT here. It is in the rail header, where it already is, and one
 * name in two places is one name that can disagree with itself.

 *
 * The three ladder rungs take the three ladder hues, in the order the ladder widens:
 * emerald executes nothing, blue executes reads on the run's own path, amber executes reads
 * AND puts one statement in the user's editor. `blocked` is not a rung — nothing executes
 * and there is nothing to widen — so it takes `fg-muted` rather than a fourth hue: it is a
 * dead end rather than a hazard, the pre-start card is where that state is alerted, and
 * `fg-muted` is the one value `theme.css` documents as reading correctly on both grounds,
 * which is what the level with no hue of its own should have.
 *
 * Palette classes and tokens only. No literal colour appears in this file, and a test
 * scans every rendered `class` attribute to keep it that way.
