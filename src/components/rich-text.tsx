 * Expects a single line: neither pattern is matched with the `s` flag, so no marker can
 * pair across a newline. Every caller splits its input on `\n` before calling this per line.

/**
 * Renders a block of model prose (#373 review).
 *
 * Measured in plan mode against a live model: the closing statement came back as
 * markdown — `### Step 1: Schema Integrity`, `* **What to inspect:** …` — and the rail
 * rendered it into one paragraph as literal characters. Plan mode's entire output is
 * one such block, so the mode read as broken.
 *
 * Three properties, in the order they matter:
 *
 *  - **No HTML parser, ever.** It is the same rule `renderInline` above was written
 *    for: this is text a model wrote after reading a database, and it reaches the page
 *    as React nodes so that escaping is structural. There is no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
 *    on this path and no markdown library that could produce one.
 *  - **Only what the models actually emit**, which is headings, bullets, bold,
 *    paragraphs, inline code and fenced blocks. Not a markdown engine: no links, no
 *    images, no tables, no ordered lists. Anything else stays the characters the model
 *    typed, which is the honest rendering of text this build does not interpret.
 *  - **A fenced block is verbatim, and it is the reason this reads fences at all**
 *    (#389). Plan mode is toolless, so its entire output is one of these blocks, and a
 *    plan worth having contains SQL. Without fence handling that SQL arrived as
 *    paragraphs of literal backticks with its whitespace collapsed — unreadable, and
 *    with no way to get it into the editor. Nothing inside a fence is read as prose:
 *    a `-` there is a minus sign and a `*` is a star, because that is what the model
 *    typed and a code block is the one place markup must not be interpreted.
 *  - **Every heading renders at ONE level**, whatever the hash count. The heading
 *    outline of the page belongs to the application; a model's hash count is a claim
 *    about the structure of its own answer, not about this document, and letting it
 *    emit an `h1` inside a timeline entry would let untrusted text pose as chrome.
 *
 * Callers are expected to render the result inside a container that keeps the quoting
 * boundary visible, because prose being READABLE must not make it look like the
 * application speaking.
