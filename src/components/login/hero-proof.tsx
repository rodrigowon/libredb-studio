/**
 * The two agent modes, in the order a user meets them.
 *
 * The descriptions are pinned to `docs/AGENT.md` and the split is load-bearing: plan mode
 * executes nothing on any engine, agent mode executes read-only and only where the provider
 * implements `queryReadOnly`. The engine names in the second line come from
 * `AGENT_EXECUTION_ENGINES`, so an engine that gains that method updates this claim without
 * a copy edit - and the count below is this array's length, never a typed "2".
 *
 * They are joined by `namedList` rather than by `join(" and ")`, which is what this file
 * used to do: with three engines that printed "PostgreSQL and SQLite and DuckDB" on the
 * login page. The helper is shared with the posture popover, which had the same join.
 *
 * `tests/components/LoginPage.test.tsx` pins the claim rather than the wording: dropping a
 * mode, or naming an engine agent mode cannot execute on, fails CI.
