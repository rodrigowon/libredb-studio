 * Shown in place of ONE monitoring panel whose read failed.
 *
 * `getMonitoringData` reads the seven panels independently, so a panel the engine cannot
 * answer is absent from the payload with its own message recorded under `errors` while the
 * rest of the dashboard still renders. This is the honest rendering of that absence: not an
 * empty table (which would claim the engine answered "nothing"), and not the whole-dashboard
 * error state (which would discard the panels that did answer). The engine's own sentence is
 * shown verbatim, because it is the only text that says what the database actually refused -
 * StarRocks 3.3 answers "Unknown table 'information_schema.PROCESSLIST'" for active sessions,
 * and that sentence is what tells the user the table is not there.
