 * a silently missing control.
 *
 * `label` is only the fallback for a provider that declares no

 * generic verb with the engine's own name for it, so MySQL titles its buttons
 * "Optimize Table" and "Check Table" rather than borrowing PostgreSQL's vocabulary.
 * `optimize` and `check` are candidates at all because the operations exist on five
 * providers and had no per-table control anywhere; the ones whose statement takes no
 * object (SQL Server's `DBCC CHECKDB`, SQLite's `PRAGMA integrity_check`) declare
 * `perEntity: false` and are filtered out here (#496).

/**
 * Why a per-table maintenance control is nowhere on this page.
 *
 * The two maintenance items in the schema explorer (`src/components/schema-explorer/TableItem.tsx`)
 * are DEEP LINKS into a maintenance surface, and they are gated on what the OPERATION declares -
 * `maintenanceControl(..., "perEntity")` - which is a different question from whether the surface
 * has a ROW to hang the control on. Per-table buttons are rendered for rows of `data.tables` only,
 * so both absence paths in this panel render none of them, and an operator who arrived asking for
 * one operation was shown an empty list that said nothing about it (U22).
 *
 * The operations are named and the table is not: nothing passes the deep link's table name into
 * this panel - `MonitoringDashboard` renders it with no search params - so naming a table here
 * would be an invention. What can be stated honestly is which controls the engine declares per
 * table and why none of them appears.
 *
 * Two things the note deliberately does NOT say:
 *  - No page to go to instead. The only caller (`MonitoringDashboard`) passes no `isAdmin`, and the
 *    prop defaults to true, so this component cannot tell an admin from the non-admin that
 *    /monitoring is the route for - and `src/proxy.ts` denies a non-admin /admin/operations. Of the
 *    two fixes available (thread the real role down, or drop the clause) dropping it is the smaller
 *    one and the only one that changes no other behaviour: threading the role would also switch off
 *    the per-row buttons on that route, which is older behaviour and not this change's business.
 *  - One cause for two inputs. `refused` is the `errors.tables` branch, where `PanelUnavailable` is
 *    already showing the engine's own reason - a permission or catalog failure as often as a missing
 *    statistic - so that branch says only what was measured here: nothing could be read.
