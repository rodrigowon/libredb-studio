/**
 * A small control that puts a block of text on the clipboard, and says whether it
 * managed to (#389).
 *
 * It exists as a component rather than as a `navigator.clipboard.writeText` call at
 * each site because of one fact about that API: **it is secure-context only.** Over
 * plain HTTP on any host but loopback `navigator.clipboard` is undefined, and this
 * product ships that way on several distribution channels — the same trap
 * `crypto.randomUUID` set in `use-query-execution.ts`, where the fix was to stop
 * reaching for the secure-context API at all. Here the API is the point, so the
 * legacy command is the fallback instead.
 *
 * Two properties follow from that, and both are what make this honest rather than
 * decorative:
 *
 *  - **The outcome is awaited.** The common pattern is to call `writeText` and flip to
 *    "Copied!" in the same statement, which reports a success nobody observed: a
 *    browser that refuses the write, a permissions policy that blocks it, and a page
 *    that is not focused all reject the promise while the label says it worked.
 *  - **A failure is said.** If both paths fail there is nothing more this control can
 *    do, so it tells the user to select the text themselves rather than leaving them
 *    to discover an empty clipboard when they paste.
