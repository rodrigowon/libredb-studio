  /**
   * Run a statement an agent run handed to this editor (#329, §2.1/§2.5 of
   * `docs/AGENT_ANALYST_DESIGN.md`; reshaped by the #373 review).
   *
   * It takes a RUN, not a statement to execute. The statement is named only so this
   * hook can label the history entry with the text the user is looking at; what is
   * sent is the run id, and the server reads the statement off that run's ledger.
   *
   * That is the whole of the security fix. This used to call `executeQuery`, which
   * goes to `POST /api/db/query` — the editor's ordinary, read-WRITE path, guarded
   * only by `isDangerousQuery`, a check on the statement's text. The agent's own read
   * is bounded by the ENGINE (`BEGIN READ ONLY`, `PRAGMA query_only`), and a `SELECT`
   * that calls a VOLATILE function performing an `INSERT` is refused there and
   * performed here. No inspection of the text can tell those apart, so the replay is
   * no longer served by a route that lacks the boundary: it goes to
   * `POST /api/agent/runs/[runId]/handover`, which runs it through `queryReadOnly`
   * under `AGENT_HANDOVER_PROFILE` at the editor's default row limit and with no
   * statement timeout — the bounds the checkbox names, enforced by the database.
   *
   * The route is named as a literal rather than imported: `src/lib/agent/*` is out of
   * the published package's module graph by construction
   * (`tests/unit/agent-package-boundary.test.ts`), and this hook is in it.
   *
   * Nothing here appends a `LIMIT`, and nothing refreshes the schema afterwards: the
   * text stays the text the run's ledger holds, and a read that the engine itself
   * holds read-only cannot have changed one.
