   * that can answer. Both fields are therefore supplied per connection here.

   *

   * reads exactly as it did before the field existed — studio treats the provider
   * as unknown and falls back to SQL and to the base labels.

// === Feature flags ===

/**
 * There is deliberately no `agent` flag here (#329).
 *
 * The agent runtime is standalone-only in Phase 1: it is gated by a server-side
 * setting the standalone shell discovers at runtime, and no embedded code path
 * reaches it. A capability declared here would therefore be set by a host and
 * never read — which is precisely the state the deprecated `inlineEditing` note
 * below records this repository as avoiding (#288). It is also not a gap a host
 * can close by asking: nothing in `StudioWorkspace` renders an agent surface,
 * and `tests/unit/agent-package-boundary.test.ts` pins that no agent module is
 * even reachable from the published entry points.
 *
 * When the embedded shell does grow one, the flag arrives in the same change as
 * the code that reads it — additive and optional, like every field here, because
 * this interface is implemented outside this repository.
 *
 * There is also no `ai` flag any more (#331 T2). It gated exactly one thing — the
 * NL2SQL panel's open state at the two `StudioWorkspace` call sites — and that
 * panel is gone, so the field would have been read nowhere at all. That is a
 * different case from the `inlineEditing` note below, which is kept: inlineEditing
 * describes a capability that still exists in the standalone shell and is expected
 * to become real in the embedded one (#279), so a host that sets it is describing
 * something coherent. `ai` would have described a surface this package no longer
 * contains — a published flag that gates nothing, which is worse than absent
 * because a host cannot tell by reading it. Removing it is a breaking change for
 * any consumer of the published `@libredb/studio` package that sets the flag, and
 * this docblock is where that change is recorded; libredb-platform was checked on
 * 2026-08-13 and never set it.

   * query adapter's `executeQuery` takes no execution options, so it could not

   * Kept rather than removed because this interface is published and implemented

   * neither implemented nor rejected is the state to avoid, and this rejects it
