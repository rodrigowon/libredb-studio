/**
 * What a statement has to look like before an EXPLAIN strategy will wrap it.
 *
 * Every strategy declines a statement it cannot explain by returning `null` from
 * `buildSql`, which hides the Explain button. That check used to be a bare
 * `/^\s*SELECT\b/i` copied into all six files, and it refused two statements every
 * dialect here explains perfectly well: a CTE, and a SELECT behind a comment. Both
 * were live-verified as accepted on PostgreSQL 18, MySQL 9, SQLite, Couchbase 8.0.2,
 * ClickHouse 26.7 and Apache Druid 37, each through the exact EXPLAIN prefix its
 * strategy emits.
 *
 * A CTE mattered for a second reason: the shared `analyzeQuery` in
 * `db/utils/query-limiter.ts` already classifies `WITH ... SELECT` as a SELECT and
 * injects a LIMIT into one, so six strategies refusing it disagreed with the rest of
 * the pipeline.
 *
 * The classification is shared but the POLICY is not - see `hasDataModifyingStatement`
 * for the one dialect that has to be stricter.
 *
 * The comment skipping itself is no longer done here: it moved to
 * `lib/sql/leading-keyword.ts` once the query limiter turned out to need the same
 * tolerance (#275), and the ReDoS reasoning that shapes the pattern moved with it.

 *   statement that leads with it is already refused by `classifySelectPrefix`, which
 *   only ever answers for `SELECT` or `WITH`. Same for `CREATE`, `DROP` and `ALTER`.

 * other leading keyword - `readLeadingKeyword` reports what it finds, and only these
 * two are explainable.
 *
 * `grammar` is optional because for most strategies the reading cannot cost more than

 * strategy must pass it: PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, …)` EXECUTES what it
 * explains, its execution path skips the confirmation gate (an explain run is not a
 * dangerous-query check), and block comments NEST in PostgreSQL - so read flat, a
 * `/* a /* b *\/ SELECT 1 *\/ DELETE FROM users` classified as a `SELECT` and the
 * explain really deleted the rows (live-verified on PostgreSQL 18: 3 rows before, 0
 * after). ClickHouse passes it too, for the honest classification rather than for

/**
 * Does this statement contain a writing keyword anywhere?
 *
 * For the one dialect whose EXPLAIN *executes* what it explains. PostgreSQL's
 * strategy emits `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, ...)`, and a data-modifying CTE is a write
 * wearing a `WITH`, so explaining one performs it. Live-verified on 18:
 *
 *     EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)
 *       WITH t AS (INSERT INTO probe(id) VALUES (42) RETURNING id) SELECT * FROM t
 *
 *     -> the row is really inserted. 0 rows before, 1 row after "only explaining".
 *
 * So a `WITH` is only explainable there when nothing in it writes. This errs toward
 * refusing: `WITH t AS (SELECT 'insert') SELECT ...` is declined even though it is
 * harmless, which costs an Explain button, while the other direction would perform a
 * write the user only asked to see. It cannot miss a real one, because a
 * data-modifying CTE is exactly an `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`MERGE` and PostgreSQL
 * refuses one anywhere but the top level ("WITH clause containing a data-modifying
 * statement must be at the top level", verified), so there is nowhere for such a
 * statement to hide behind a leading `SELECT`.
 *
 * That last point is why the guard is scoped to the `with` case in the caller rather
 * than applied to every statement: a statement leading with `SELECT` cannot carry one,
 * so screening those too would only strip the Explain button off queries that merely
 * mention a keyword - `SELECT 'insert'` explains fine today and must keep doing so.
