 *
 * The cast changes nothing about what reaches the server: mysql2 validates

 * must not contain undefined. To pass SQL NULL specify JS null", thrown from
 * lib/base/connection.js). It is not coerced to NULL, before or after this
 * change - callers wanting SQL NULL must pass `null`. The new typing states

 * PREPARED one. Everything here used to call `execute`, parameterless statements
 * included, and three engines refuse whole statement classes on that protocol
 * with `This command is not supported in the prepared statement protocol yet`:
 *
 * - SingleStore 9.1.1 (`ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:0.2.82`),
 *   measured 2026-08-24 both ways over one connection: `SHOW STATUS`,
 *   `SHOW VARIABLES`, `EXPLAIN`, `EXPLAIN JSON`, `OPTIMIZE TABLE` and
 *   `CHECK TABLE` all fail prepared with `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` and all succeed as
 *   text. `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` is NOT in that list: it is `ER_PARSE_ERROR` on
 *   both protocols there, because SingleStore's grammar is `EXPLAIN JSON`, so the
 *   Explain panel is not something this helper recovers.
 * - StarRocks 3.3, whose overview this recovers (measured through the provider,
 *   2026-08-24); its health still fails on a missing
 *   `information_schema.PROCESSLIST`, which is the engine's gap, not the protocol.
 * - MySQL 26.7.0 itself refuses `CHECK TABLE` prepared - measured 2026-08-24 on
 *   `mysql:latest` - so one maintenance action was unavailable on the engine this
 *   provider is named for.
 *
 * A parameterised statement keeps `execute`: the placeholders are what the
 * prepared protocol is for, and binding is what keeps a value out of the SQL text.
 * An empty array carries no parameter and is nothing to bind, so it takes the text
 * path with the parameterless statements.
 *
 * Moving the read path across is safe because the two protocols decode to the same
 * JS shapes. Measured 2026-08-24 on MySQL 26.7.0 over one connection, the same
 * SELECT both ways across TINYINT(1), INT, BIGINT past 2^53, BIGINT UNSIGNED,
 * DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, TIME, YEAR, CHAR, VARCHAR,
 * TEXT, BLOB, BIT(1), BIT(8), JSON, ENUM, SET and NULLs: every value identical by
 * `typeof` and by `JSON.stringify`, every `FieldPacket` identical in `columnType`,
 * `flags`, `characterSet`, `columnLength` and `decimals` - so `columnTypes` names
 * the same types - and a non-result-set statement answers the same
 * `ResultSetHeader`, which is what `buildQueryResult` reads. See
 * `docs/providers/mysql.md` section 3.4.

 *
 * The statement does NOT throw when the server refuses it: measured through this
 * provider against MySQL 26.7.0 (`libredb-mysql`) on 2026-08-25, `OPTIMIZE TABLE
 * \`missing\`` resolves normally and answers
 *
 *   [{ Table: 'u9t.missing', Op: 'optimize', Msg_type: 'Error',

 *    { Table: 'u9t.missing', Op: 'optimize', Msg_type: 'status',
 *      Msg_text: 'Operation failed' }]
 *
 * so `await runStatement(...); return { success: true }` reported a completed
 * operation for a statement the server had rejected - and discarded the `Msg_text`
 * that is the entire point of `CHECK TABLE`, whose OK-or-corruption-report is the only
 * thing the user asked for. `Msg_type` is the decision (`'Error'` from the server,
 * matched case-insensitively because the manual documents the set in lower case), and
 * the same read is what SQLite's `check` already does with `PRAGMA integrity_check`.
 *
 * The whole-database form names every table in one statement, so a failing table is
 * quoted WITH its name - it is the only place the failure appears - while a successful
 * run quotes the messages alone and deduplicates them: over forty tables the OK and
 * InnoDB's "doing recreate + analyze instead" note repeat once per table and say the
 * same thing forty times.

 * top five digests for a schema come back whether they took 15 ms or 15 hours. So on any

 * referent (`src/lib/agent/tools.ts`, and #513). The cap is still
 * written here: nothing downstream can tell a cap from a count, so the only place the
 * distinction can be recorded is where the limit is applied.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-27 on MySQL 26.7.0: the digest table held 59 rows for one connected
 * schema, and the five this statement returns for it were ALL Studio's own introspection
 * statements, with the slow-query read itself first at `avg 79.11ms, calls 3` and the rest
 * between 1.15 ms and 7.78 ms. Nothing in that list is slow and none of it is the user's
 * workload; what the reading honestly reports is "the five heaviest digests recorded for

   * and the base *"Run Vacuum" / "Reclaim Space"* copy on the Operations tab, for an
   * engine whose operations are `analyze`/`optimize`/`check`/`kill` (#496). The words
   * below name what MySQL actually runs, and `vacuumActionOperation` says which
   * operation the surfaces should send for them.
   *
   * `getSlowQueries()` reads `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest`,
   * and the panel used to name PostgreSQL's extension in its empty state (#463) - a
   * statement store MySQL does not have under any name.
   *
   * The sentence describes the SOURCE and what an empty list means about it, and stops
   * there. It cannot do more: `QueriesTab` renders this one fixed string for every empty
   * list whatever produced it, so any instruction in it is addressed to causes it cannot
   * tell apart. It used to end "enable the Performance Schema to see them", which named
   * the one cause that never reaches the failure path at all (off-ness answers 0 rows,
   * measured; see `getSlowQueries()`) and was unactionable advice for the ones that do -
   * a denied grant, or a tenant with no `performance_schema` database. Those now reject
   * instead of emptying, and the panel shows the server's own reason through
   * `PanelUnavailable`, which is a different string on a different branch.

  /**
   * The digests, or the server's refusal - this read does NOT swallow.
   *
   * It used to `return []` on any throw, with a comment saying the reason travelled
   * through `ProviderLabels.slowQueriesEmptyState` instead. It did not: that label is
   * one fixed sentence rendered for every empty list whatever produced it, and the
   * sentence this provider declares names the Performance Schema - the one cause that
   * never reaches here.
   *
   * What never reaches here is off-ness. Measured 2026-08-27, a server with
   * `@@performance_schema` = 0 keeps the digest table selectable and answers 0 rows
   * (MySQL 26.7.0 started `--performance-schema=OFF`, MariaDB 12.3.2 which ships it off),
   * so an unreadable source is the ONLY thing that throws: no `performance_schema`
   * DATABASE at all (ER_1049 on an OceanBase tenant) or the grant denied on it -
   *
   *   errno=1142 code=ER_TABLEACCESS_DENIED_ERROR sqlState=42000
   *   SELECT command denied to user 'nops'@'...' for table
   *   'events_statements_summary_by_digest'
   *
   * measured on MySQL 26.7.0 with a user holding only `SELECT ON d32.*` plus `PROCESS`.
   * Letting that reject is what puts the reason in front of the operator: it becomes
   * `errors.slowQueries` in `getMonitoringData()` (src/lib/db/base-provider.ts), which
   * reads every panel with `Promise.allSettled` and records a rejected one by name, and
   * `QueriesTab` renders it through `PanelUnavailable` carrying the server's own
   * sentence. One rejected panel costs nothing else: that method throws only when all
   * four core reads reject. This is also what the PostgreSQL provider already does - it
   * falls back to `pg_stat_activity` and lets a failure of THAT propagate.
