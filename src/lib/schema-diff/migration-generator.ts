 * one addition of its own: this provider closes its Hrana stream in the same request as
 * each statement, so a BEGIN it emitted could not be continued by the app that generated
 * the file. `cassandra` has no transaction at all - measured on 5.0.9, `BEGIN;` is "line
 * 1:5 mismatched input ';' expecting K_BATCH" and `COMMIT;` is "no viable alternative at
 * input 'COMMIT'". The only grouping CQL has is `BEGIN BATCH ... APPLY BATCH`, which is
 * not a transaction and takes no DDL, so there is nothing to translate the wrapper INTO -
 * it can only be left out. Unlike the other two, Cassandra's OTHER statements in this
 * generator were each measured against a live server too, so the wrapper would have been
 * the only unrunnable line in an otherwise runnable migration.
 *
 * The other nine are new, and each reuses a fact this module (or `src/lib/sql/grammar.ts`)
 * already established for a different fallback rather than asserting a fresh one:
 * `mongodb` and `redis` write no SQL text at all (`NON_SQL_DIALECTS` in `grammar.ts`), and
 * wrapping non-SQL command text in SQL statements is wrong regardless of Mongo's own
 * driver-level transaction API; `libredb` "speaks a JSON command grammar, not SQL DDL"
 * (`NO_COLUMN_MODIFICATION`'s own words); `couchbase` HAS distributed ACID transactions,
 * but spells one `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and answers with a `txid` that every following
 * statement has to carry as a request parameter (`docs/providers/couchbase.md` §13) - a
 * shape a flat migration file cannot express at all, so `BEGIN;` is both the wrong
 * keyword and the wrong mechanism; `druid` has no transaction concept to translate the
 * wrapper into ("Druid SQL has no ALTER TABLE", `NO_COLUMN_MODIFICATION`; a datasource is
 * rewritten by an MSQ task, not by a bracketed statement list); `elasticsearch` and
 * `opensearch` do not have `BEGIN` in their grammar at all - the parse error quoted in
 * `NO_COLUMN_MODIFICATION` lists every statement Elasticsearch SQL accepts and `BEGIN` is
 * not among them, and OpenSearch 3.8.0 was measured separately
 * (`docs/providers/opensearch.md` §9); `trino`'s transactional semantics are the CONNECTOR's answer, not a
 * property of Trino itself (`NO_COLUMN_MODIFICATION`), so no portable `BEGIN;`/`COMMIT;`
 * exists; and `clickhouse`'s transaction support is experimental and setting-gated rather
 * than a safe default — this set is what removes it from the wrapper it used to inherit.
 *
 * Oracle DDL commits implicitly and BEGIN opens a PL/SQL block, not a transaction.

 * Why a Cassandra CREATE is refused here rather than emitted.
 *
 * A CQL primary key is two things at once: the partition key, which decides which node holds a row,
 * and the clustering columns, which order rows inside that partition. The brackets carry that
 * distinction and nothing else does. Measured on 5.0.9 with two probe tables that differ only in one
 * pair of them — `probe.composite_pk` is `PRIMARY KEY ((tenant, day), ts)`, `probe.pk_flat` is
 * `PRIMARY KEY (tenant, day, ts)`: `SELECT * FROM probe.pk_flat WHERE tenant = 'a'` is served, while
 * the same restriction on `probe.composite_pk` answers code 2200, "Cannot execute this query as it
 * might involve data filtering and thus may have unpredictable performance". So the two spellings are
 * different tables, not two ways of writing one.
 *
 * `system_schema.columns` distinguishes them by `kind` (`partition_key` vs `clustering`), but
 * `ColumnDiff` keeps only `targetIsPrimary` — both tables above reduce to the same three key columns —
 * so the bracketing is not recoverable from a diff and the shared `PRIMARY KEY (a, b, c)` serializer
 * below would silently pick the flat layout. Guessing the physical layout of a table is not a
 * cosmetic error, so this path declines the way the rest of the module declines: a comment naming the
 * limitation, which a human can read, instead of DDL that would run and be wrong.
 *
 * The provider already publishes `supportsCreateTable: false` (`sql/cassandra/index.ts`) for the
 * neighbouring reason — what `CreateTableModal` emits is not valid CQL — but `SchemaDiff.tsx` calls
 * this generator with the connection's type and never consults capabilities, so the refusal has to be
 * repeated here or the two contradict each other.

 * the two answer identically; the labels are spelled out per id anyway, because a reader wants the
 * name of the engine they connected to (the same reason the neighbouring libSQL branches exist).
 *
 * SQLite's ALTER TABLE page enumerates every schema change the engine has - "rename table", "rename
 * column", "add column", "drop column", plus SET/DROP NOT NULL since 3.53.0 - and adding a constraint
 * is not among them; it routes such a change through its own 12-step table-recreation procedure.
 * Measured on sqlite3 3.53.3: `ALTER TABLE "users" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_users_dept_id" FOREIGN KEY
 * ("dept_id") REFERENCES "departments"("id")` is `near "FOREIGN": syntax error` - the parser has
 * already taken `CONSTRAINT` for a column name and the quoted name for its type - and the same
 * statement over Hrana on sqld 0.24.33 is `near CONSTRAINT ... syntax error`. Two tokens, one verdict.
 *
 * Both emission paths read this map and answer it DIFFERENTLY, which is the point of naming the fact
 * once (#515). `generateCreateTable` is building the table right there, so it moves the key
 * INSIDE the statement, where SQLite's grammar does take it; `generateAlterTable` has no such place
