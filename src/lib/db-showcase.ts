 * The order is recognisability-first: an evaluator scanning the login page should meet
 * the names they already know before the ones they do not. It is deliberately NOT the
 * connection picker's order (`selectableTypes`, src/hooks/use-connection-form.ts),
 * which groups by connect-form affordance instead. The two lists answer different
