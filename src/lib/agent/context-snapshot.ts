/**
 * The run's context snapshot, and the packing that puts part of it in a prompt
 * (#329 T8, epic #325).
 *
 * A run reasons about a schema it has to be told about, and the two obvious ways to
 * tell it are both wrong: reaching a provider BESIDE the M1 enforcement layer, and
 * serialising the whole inventory into every prompt, which spends the context window
 * on tables the task is not about. This module does neither.
 *
 *  - **Every read goes through the audited pipeline, and there are now TWO of them**
 *    (#414). On a dialect `CATALOG_PLANS` serves, `captureContextSnapshot` calls
 *    `readCatalogForGrounding`, which composes the statement server-side and drives
 *    it through `executeAuditedOperation` under the read-only profile. On every other
 *    dialect it calls `readProviderSchemaForGrounding`, which asks the provider for
 *    its own schema inspection — the reading the sidebar already performs — under the
 *    operations profile.
 *
 *    The second path is not the objection above returning under a new name, and the
 *    difference is mechanical rather than a matter of degree. What "asking the
 *    provider directly" meant was a call with no operation descriptor naming it, no
 *    policy able to deny it, no budget charged for it and no audit line recording it.
 *    This one has all four: `db.schema.read` is a canonical R0 descriptor, the call
 *    is admitted by the run deadline, costs a statement out of `maxStatementsPerRun`,
 *    is denied or allowed by the same policy as every other reach, and lands on the
 *    audit stream under its own operation id — which an operator can deny on its own
 *    without denying any other agent read. So a snapshot still costs the run
 *    something, is still refusable, and there is still no seam for a faster path.
 *
 *    The two paths are a real asymmetry rather than a transitional state, and
 *    PostgreSQL and SQLite deliberately do NOT converge on the provider one. Three
 *    reasons, all of them properties the composed path has and this one cannot:
 *    the composed reads are audited STATEMENT BY STATEMENT rather than as one opaque
 *    call; they carry foreign keys, which the provider path cannot on any engine that
 *    does not declare them; and SQLite's inventory is parsed out of the DDL text the
 *    engine stored, which its provider does not expose in the same shape.
 *  - **The catalog path's rows come back out of the run's artifact store**, keyed by
 *    the correlation id the tool returned — the same store a later claim cites. A
 *    result that has been released or has expired yields no snapshot rather than a
 *    reconstruction from the model-facing text. The provider path does not round-trip
 *    through the store, because it never turned its inventory into text: it returns
 *    the tables themselves and puts a projection of them in the artifact so the call
 *    is still citable. See `readProviderSchemaForGrounding`.
 *  - **The inventory is all-or-nothing.** One refused read loses the whole
 *    snapshot, because an inventory missing its keys while claiming to be whole is
 *    worse than no inventory: the model would reason about relations that are
 *    simply absent from what it was shown. The run then continues WITHOUT a
 *    snapshot and is told to use `inspect_schema` itself, narrowed.
 *
 * The fingerprint is a function of the inventory and nothing else — not of the
 * reading time, not of the connection — so two identical builds agree and a changed
 * schema does not.
 *
 * A captured inventory is also HELD for its connection, in this process, and that is
 * one of the three places a planning run's grounding can come from (#384). It was the
 * ONLY one until 2026-08-15, which is what made plan mode blind after a restart and
 * on a second replica; a plan run now captures its own inventory when neither its
 * ledger nor this hold has one, and fills the hold in turn. The model stays toolless
 * on every one of those paths. See `holdSnapshotForConnection`.
 *
 * That is what makes the REFRESH free. A capture is recorded in the run's ledger
 * with the inventory attached, so a later drive — including one that resumed after
 * the process died — calls `reusableSnapshot` and re-derives its whole schema
 * context from the record it has already read, performing no database operation at
 * all. The fingerprint is the key: the recorded entry is trusted only when the
 * identity it advertises is the one its own inventory produces.
 *
 * SQLite and PostgreSQL answer differently and the asymmetry is structural, not
 * cosmetic: PostgreSQL aggregates columns per table (relations/indexes stay flat), while SQLite has no
 * structured catalog on this path at all (the guard refuses every `pragma_*`
 * function) and its columns, keys and relations are read out of the DDL text the
 * engine stored — see `sqlite-ddl.ts`.

 * The same snapshot, read through the engine's own schema inspection (#414).
 *
 * The tables are NORMALISED before they become a snapshot: name, columns, indexes,
 * foreign keys, and nothing else. `rowCount` and `size` are what get dropped, and
 * dropping them is the point rather than tidiness. The fingerprint is over the
 * schema; a row estimate is not schema, so keeping it would make an inventory change
 * identity every time somebody inserted a row — and each provider means something
 * different by the number anyway (`estimatedDocumentCount` on MongoDB, a scanned key
 * sample on Redis, `TABLE_ROWS` on MySQL). Worse, it would arrive unlabelled through
 * a path that never announced it had one, which is exactly the kind of silent claim
 * this run is not allowed to make. Statistics have their own read and their own
 * honest "this engine holds none" answer (`schema-stats.ts`).
 *
 * `finalize` is reused rather than reimplemented, so the ordering and therefore the
 * fingerprint are produced by the same code the composed path uses: two readings of
 * the same schema have to agree whichever route reached them, or `reusableSnapshot`
 * and `holdSnapshotForConnection` would reject a run's own recorded capture.
 *
 * All-or-nothing, exactly as the composed path is. A refused read, a provider that
 * could not be reached, a schema the provider rejected the request for, and a read
 * that overran its time all lose the WHOLE snapshot: a partial inventory presented as
 * complete is the failure this module exists to avoid, and it is no less one for
 * having been read a second way.
 *
 * A failure raised BEFORE the reading left becomes an unavailable capture, rather than
 * propagating and ending the run — `environmentFailure` is where that is read, and the
 * composed path asks it too now (B48). That is a decision, and the
 * reason is what plan mode promises: it opens and answers on every engine, and it did
 * on these nine before this change, because nothing was reached at all. Letting an
 * unreachable host, a wrong password, a refused `connect()` or an `ExecutionProfileError`
 * from a half-configured `agentUser` out of here would lose a plan run to an
 * IMPROVEMENT — and on the profile error it would lose it under
 * "the agent cannot run on this database engine: it offers no read-only execution
 * profile", said about an engine where plan mode demonstrably works. The user is still
 * told: the ungrounded note carries this capture's own diagnosis, so what reaches the
 * model is that the reading did not happen and why, which is the whole of what an
 * ungrounded run is owed. Anything that is NOT one of these two classes propagates —
 * a `TypeError` here is this server's bug and must not be reported to a user as a
 * property of their database.
 *
 * The COMPOSED path answers the same environment the same way, which it did not when
 * this was written: #414 left PostgreSQL and SQLite propagating such a failure on the
 * argument that they had never reached this line, and B48 is the record of a reader
 * tripping over the asymmetry. Both paths now read it through `environmentFailure`.
 *
 * Neither sentence carries the error's own message. `detail` is spliced into the note
 * a plan run reads as the server's own voice, and a driver message is text the database
 * wrote; the fenced diagnoses arrive that way from the tool layer, and these do not go
 * through it.

/**
 * The inventories this PROCESS has already read, one per connection (#384).
 *
 * It exists to spare a second reading of a catalog this process has already read.
 * That was originally stated as existing FOR planning mode, which could read no
 * catalog of its own and was otherwise reduced to writing the plan it would write
 * about any database in the world — what live runs on 2026-08-15 actually produced.
 * Since the plan-mode grounding design of that date a plan run captures its own
 * inventory when this holds none, so the hold is a fast path rather than the only
 * path, and it is filled by both modes.
 *
 * Three properties are what make that safe rather than merely cheap:
 *
 *  - **Nothing here ever reads a database.** Entries arrive only from
 *    `captureContextSnapshot`, which goes through the T6 catalog tool; this module
 *    adds no second path to an engine.
 *  - **An entry is refused unless its identity is the one its own inventory
 *    produces**, exactly as `reusableSnapshot` refuses a ledger entry. A snapshot
 *    that fingerprints as something else is not held at all, so a reader never has
 *    to decide whether to trust one.
 *  - **It is keyed by connection IDENTITY**, which is a stricter boundary than the
 *    one the run loop enforces (`RUN_CONNECTION_MISMATCH`) and deliberately so.
 *    Everyone who can open a run on a connection can read its catalog through that
 *    run anyway, so the id would have been enough for access; what it is not enough
 *    for is TRUTH. The original key was the connection id alone, and a connection
 *    record re-pointed at another database while keeping its id was served the old
 *    one's inventory. The key is now a hash over the fields that decide which
 *    database a reading came from and whose view of it (`connectionIdentity` below,
 *    #509), and it matters more now that a plan run both fills this and reads it.
 *
 * What it deliberately is NOT: durable. This is process memory, like the run-scoped
 * artifact store and for the same reason. Losing it on a restart no longer costs a
 * plan run its grounding — it costs one catalog read, because the run captures its
 * own — so what a miss buys is a statement, not the difference between a grounded
 * plan and a blind one.

 *
 * The hold used to be keyed on the connection id alone (#509). Neither
 * the key nor the snapshot carried any database identity — `AgentContextSnapshot` holds
 * an id, a fingerprint, a time and the tables — so a connection record re-pointed at
 * another database while keeping its id was served the old one's inventory until the
 * entry aged out or the process restarted. Editing a saved connection to aim at staging
 * instead of production is an ordinary thing to do, and the id does not change when you
 * do it.
 *
 * It mattered before the plan-mode grounding work and it matters more after it: what the
 * hold serves is now the ground a drafted statement is VALIDATED against, so a statement
 * checked against another database's tables comes back with no unknown names — the card
 * reports "checked" for a check performed against the wrong catalog. That is the exact
 * class of claim this whole design item exists to stop making.
 *
 * Over-keying is deliberately the safe direction. A miss costs ONE catalog read, because
 * a plan run captures its own inventory when the hold has nothing for it; a false hit
 * costs a confident answer about a database nobody looked at. So the user fields are in
 * here too — a least-privilege role sees a different catalog — while the password is
 * not: rotating a credential does not change which database this is.
 *
 * Hashed rather than concatenated because `connectionString` can carry a password, and a
 * process-lifetime map should not hold one as a key.

 * tool to name says nothing. The omission ITSELF is never optional: a model shown a
 * silently truncated list believes it has seen the schema.
 *
 * `noun` is what the rows are CALLED on this engine, and it is a parameter for the
 * same reason the preface is: this function keeps the bound, so the header it counts
 * has to be the header it writes. Defaulting to `TABLE_INVENTORY_NOUN` keeps every

 *
 * An index's own columns are left out for the same reason the table's are: they are the
