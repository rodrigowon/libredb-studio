/**
 * The SQL the SERVER composes for an agent run (#329, epic #325; planning decision P1).
 *
 * Two of the M2 tools do not take a statement from the model at all. A catalog
 * inspection takes a structured selector and a plan inspection takes the statement
 * it is about; in both cases the statement that reaches the database is written
 * here, per dialect. That is what lets a schema read BE the canonical bounded read
 * (`sql.query.read`) instead of needing a fourth operation descriptor, which the
 * epic pinned shut.
 *
 * Three constraints shape every string below:
 *
 * 1. **The composed statement must satisfy the M1 input guard**, or the tool can
 *    never run. That rules out more than it looks like: `statement-guard.ts`
 *    refuses any word beginning `PRAGMA_`, so SQLite's `pragma_table_info()`
 *    table-valued function — the obvious way to read a column list there — is
 *    unavailable, and the SQLite catalog read goes through `sqlite_master`
 *    instead. The asymmetry is real and documented on the tool: PostgreSQL yields
 *    a structured column inventory, SQLite yields each object's own DDL text.
 * 2. **The profiled providers bind nothing.** `queryReadOnly(sql, budget)` takes no
 *    parameters (`postgres.ts`, `sqlite.ts`), so a selector cannot be bound and has
 *    to be quoted with the shared `quoteLiteral`. Selectors are therefore validated
 *    here as well as quoted — see `assertSelector` for the one character that is
 *    refused rather than quoted, and why.
 * 3. **No dialect is served on a guess.** Both maps are looked up with
 *    `Object.hasOwn`, and an unlisted dialect is refused. A composition that has
 *    not been checked against that engine's catalog and its EXPLAIN grammar is not
 *    a fallback, it is a statement nobody verified.
 *
 * On the plan side: the composed form is the ESTIMATING one on both engines, never
 * the executing one. `src/lib/explain`'s PostgreSQL strategy is deliberately not
 * reused for this — its `buildSql` ignores the `mode` argument and always emits
 * `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)`, which RUNS the statement it explains.
 * That is correct for the editor's Explain button (a user asked for real timings)
 * and exactly wrong here, where the approval-gated `sql.explain.analyze` descriptor
 * is the only thing allowed to execute a plan. Teaching the strategy registry to
 * honour its own mode argument is a separate, editor-visible change (#194).

 * calling role OWNS or holds a privilege on other than `SELECT`. The least-privilege
 * role `docs/AGENT_DEMO.md` tells operators to create holds `SELECT` and nothing
 * else, so those views answered NOTHING for it — measured on the seeded dvdrental as
 * `libredb_agent`: 0 rows where `pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'f'` holds 18, and a
 * run then reported that the database declares no foreign keys. `pg_constraint` needs
 * only `USAGE` on the schema, and answers all 18. What the rewrite cannot reach is that
 * ANY role can be narrower than its database, so the relations block declines to report
 * an absence from an empty read at all — see `er-diagram.ts`.
 *
 * The same rewrite is what pairs a composite key. Neither view exposes an ordinal,
 * so `FOREIGN KEY (x, y) REFERENCES parents (a, b)` came back as the cross-product
 * of the two column lists; `unnest(conkey, confkey) WITH ORDINALITY` unnests the two
 * arrays TOGETHER, so position 1 of one side meets position 1 of the other and
 * nothing else. And it closes the collision underneath: a constraint NAME is unique
 * per table, so two tables in one schema may both carry `fk_shared` and the
 * referenced side could not be narrowed by table at all — `constraint_column_usage`
 * exposes no referencing table. A `pg_constraint` row carries `conrelid` and
 * `confrelid` on itself and is never matched by name.
 *
 * Both defects compounded rather than sitting side by side, which is why they were
 * fixed together: on a fixture holding a composite key and a second constraint of
 * the same name, the old joins returned NINE rows — three right — and gave one table
 * edges to a table its own constraint never mentions. This read returns the three.
 *
 * The output column names are the ones `buildPostgresTables` already reads, so the
 * fold consuming these rows is unchanged. The projection stays flat — one row per
 * referencing COLUMN — because the row cap refuses rather than truncates, and a flat
 * overflow is diagnosable where a nested aggregate's is not.

 *
 * FOUR things a consumer of these rows must not read as more than they are, all of
 * them consequences of the source rather than of this projection:
 *
 *  - **`reltuples` is an estimate, and `-1` means "never counted".** PostgreSQL 14+
 *    initialises it to -1 for a relation that has been neither `VACUUM`ed nor
 *    `ANALYZE`d; older servers left it at 0, which is indistinguishable from an
 *    empty table. A reader that prints -1 as a row count states a falsehood.
 *  - **`n_distinct` is NEGATIVE when it is a ratio.** PostgreSQL stores `-k` to mean
 *    "k * reltuples distinct values" (so -1 is a unique column) when the estimated
 *    count scales with the table. The conversion is deliberately NOT done here: it
 *    needs `reltuples`, which is itself an estimate that may be -1, and a converted
 *    number emitted under the name `n_distinct` would be a derived value wearing the
 *    raw one's name. Both columns go out raw and the reader converts and LABELS the
 *    result as derived (work item 2).
 *  - **A never-analysed table has no `pg_stats` rows at all**, which is why the join
 *    is a LEFT JOIN from `pg_class`. The table then appears once with every
 *    statistics column NULL — present and unknown, rather than absent. An inner join
 *    would omit it, and silence reads as zero.
 *  - **`pg_stats` is permission-filtered.** It is a view over `pg_statistic` that
 *    returns rows only for tables the calling role may read, so a least-privilege
 *    agent role sees "no statistics" for a table it cannot select from — the same
 *    shape as never analysed, and not distinguishable from here.
 *
 * `relkind` is restricted to ordinary (`r`) and partitioned (`p`) tables: those are
 * the relkinds `pg_stats` describes and that a plan's row estimates come from. A
 * view has no statistics of its own, and including one would add a row whose every
 * statistic is NULL for a reason unrelated to `ANALYZE`.

 * `PRIMARY KEY (id)`, a `UNIQUE INDEX` and a plain index, `duckdb_indexes()` returned

 * read as unindexed because the constraint's index carries no DDL text. It also
 * carries the only primary-key information on this engine's agent path: the column
 * read publishes no `is_primary`, so without this union nothing a run can read says
 * which columns are the key.
 *
 * `expressions` is cast to a real list (`expressions::VARCHAR[]`) rather than parsed:
 * it prints as `[a, b]` in its VARCHAR form and the cast is measured to produce
 * `["a","b"]`, so an expression index needs no hand parsing here. Both halves are
 * subscripted by a shared ordinal for the reason `composeDuckdbRelations` records, and
