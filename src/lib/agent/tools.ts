/**
 * The agent's tool layer over the M1 operation pipeline (#329, epic #325).
 *
 * This is the only place in the agent runtime that reaches a database, and it does
 * so through exactly one path: `executeAuditedOperation` (`src/lib/db/operations/`)
 * against a provider acquired under the agent read-only execution profile. There is
 * no second path, no direct `provider.query()`, and no provider method reached
 * outside a registered operation — a reach that skipped this module would be a
 * defect by the milestone's own constraint, not a shortcut.
 *
 * Four properties are load-bearing, and each is asserted rather than asserted-in-prose:
 *
 * 1. **Tool selection is a server-side function of the run's persisted mode and
 *    workflow type.** `selectAgentTools` reads nothing else. Planning yields an EMPTY set whatever
 *    the run is for, and
 *    a client-supplied tool list has no way in — not because it is filtered, but
 *    because there is no parameter for it. The same rule is enforced a second time
 *    at the execution seam, and since the plan-mode grounding design of 2026-08-15
 *    the seam states it precisely: outside agent mode a call is refused
 *    (`MODE_HAS_NO_TOOLS`, before the ledger, the deadline or an acquisition) UNLESS
 *    it is marked `grounding`, which is the server establishing a plan run's context
 *    before the model's first turn. Nothing a model sends can carry that flag — a
 *    planning run is still handed an empty tool set, so no dispatch of a model's tool
 *    call reaches the seam at all — and the two exported grounding entry points
 *    (`readCatalogForGrounding`, `readStatementForGrounding`) are called by
 *    `establishContext` with SERVER-composed statements. The property that survives
 *    unchanged is the one that matters: no model, in any mode, executes anything the
 *    selector did not offer it. What is NOT claimed is that the seam is a boundary
 *    against the server's own callers: `readStatementForGrounding` takes arbitrary
 *    SQL, and what keeps it read-only is the same statement guard, policy, profile
 *    and audit trail every other call meets, not the mode check.
 * 2. **A policy denial is a different KIND of outcome than a database error.** The
 *    two travel as distinct variants of `AgentToolRefusal` (T2 pinned that union so
 *    a denial has no readable `message` field at all), and the text handed to the
 *    model says a boundary decided this, never that the statement was ill-formed.
 *    Feeding a denial back as if it were bad SQL is what turns a refusal into a
 *    repair loop against the security layer.
 * 3. **The repair loop is bounded and never repeats a failed statement.** Every
 *    call passes the run's `AgentRepairLedger` first, keyed on a canonical
 *    fingerprint. A denial records the statement as unrepeatable but does NOT
 *    consume a repair attempt: nothing ran, and there is nothing to repair.
 * 4. **Database content is untrusted input.** Every result and every engine message
 *    that crosses into a prompt goes through `fenceUntrustedContent` first. Nothing
 *    in this module hands a model text that a row could have written.
 *
 * The run's wall-clock deadline (`deadline.ts`) is consulted here too, because this
 * is the layer that knows a call is about to be made: `admit` refuses a call that
 * no longer fits and clamps the statement timeout down to what is left of the run.
 * The clamp is applied by handing the pipeline a policy whose `statementTimeoutMs`
 * is the granted value, so the timeout the execution profile receives is the
 * pipeline's own `effectiveBudget` — there is no second budget to keep in step.
 *
 * The provider acquirer is INJECTED rather than imported. Two reasons, both real:
 * the spy-provider invariant above needs a seam, and a static import of
 * `@/lib/db/factory` would make this module's behaviour depend on whether some
 * other test file has replaced that module process-wide (`mock.module` is global —
 * five suites already stub the factory). Only the `ExecutionProfile` TYPE is
 * imported, so the profile literal still cannot drift from the factory's vocabulary.

 * ledger-only, its refusal records no event and the run is scored `no-answer` with nothing saying
 * why: the same invisible failure this fix exists to remove, re-created for correct models instead
 * of sloppy ones. Reading here leaves the advertised schema byte-identical to what it always was.
 *
 * That placement puts a dependency between this read and the run loop, and it is worth naming
 * because it is invisible from here. The SDK validates the model's arguments against this same
 * strict schema BEFORE any of this runs, and a serialized presentation fails it: measured against
 * `ai@7.0.59`, `doParseToolCall` throws, the SDK catches it, re-parses the raw JSON without a
 * schema and enqueues the tool-call part anyway with `invalid: true`. So this function is reached
 * only because `takeTurn` dispatches every tool-call part without consulting that flag
 * (src/lib/agent/investigation.ts:1042). Hardening that line to `!part.invalid` would drop the call
 * before it arrives here and silently undo this fix — and it is a plausible edit rather than an
 * imagined one, because `capability-probe.ts:279` already treats the flag as meaningful
 * (`part.invalid !== true`). `tests/isolated/agent-investigation.test.ts` drives the whole path
 * through the real SDK so that edit fails a test rather than a run.

/**
 * What a denial tells the model it may try next. Three answers, because the codes

 *
 * - `absolute` — the run is not permitted to do this at all (privilege, risk class,
 *   budget, a malformed server context). No statement the model writes changes it,
 *   and saying otherwise invites a repair loop against the security layer.
 * - `shape` — the statement fell outside the bounded-read CONTRACT. Not a syntax
 *   error (the SQL may be perfectly valid), and a differently shaped read genuinely
 *   can be admitted: the guard refuses `SELECT copy FROM ads` because `copy` reads
 *   as a side-effect word and admits `SELECT "copy" FROM ads`, which
 *   `statement-guard.ts` records as the escape hatch. Telling the model not to
 *   bother is how a legitimate column becomes unreachable for the whole run.
 * - `target` — the DECLARED target is outside the run's scope. The statement's
 *   wording is irrelevant, but a tool that takes a target selector (today
 *   `inspect_schema`) can be asked for an in-scope one instead.
 *
 * A total `Record` rather than a comparison against a string: a new
 * `PolicyDenyCode` must not silently inherit whichever branch happened to be the
 * default. This is the same compiler-mirror pattern `DENY_REASONS` uses in
 * `execution.ts` and `DEADLINE_REASONS` uses below.
 *
 * The advice is keyed on the DENY CODE and not on the tool, which is a real
 * imprecision worth naming: for `inspect_schema` and `inspect_plan` the statement is
 * server-composed, so an `INPUT_VALIDATION_FAILED` there would be a server defect
 * rather than something the model shaped, and `shape`'s "a differently shaped read
 * may still be admitted" is advice it cannot act on. Left as-is on purpose. No
 * reachable case exists — every composed statement in `composed-sql.ts` is guard-clean
 * for both dialects and pinned by a test, and `inspect_plan`'s only model-supplied
 * part is the inner statement, which genuinely IS a shape the model chose. A per-tool
 * override would therefore be an uncoverable branch under the 100% line gate, which is
 * a worse trade than a sentence that is imprecise only in a state that cannot occur.

/**
 * Failures of the environment the statement RAN IN. No statement the model writes

 * hidden from the caller.
 *
 * Note which classes are deliberately NOT here, because both look like they belong
 * and both would re-break the repair loop:
 *
 * - **`AuthenticationError`** covers two unrelated events. `mapDatabaseError` answers
 *   it for anything matching `password`/`authentication`/`access denied`/
 *   `permission denied` (`errors.ts:270-277`), which folds a wrong agent credential
 *   together with `permission denied for table secrets`. The second is routine on the
 *   least-privilege `agentUser` this programme recommends — per-table `SELECT` grants
 *   are what bound an agent's reads — so it is the model's first probe of an ungranted
 *   object, and reading a different table is exactly the repair that helps. They are
 *   indistinguishable by class but not by PHASE, which is what `runStatement` splits
 *   on: a credential failure happens while connecting, a grant failure while running.
 * - **`QueryCancelledError`** is what a PostgreSQL statement timeout arrives as, and
 *   this layer is what CAUSES it: the clamped budget becomes `SET LOCAL
 *   statement_timeout` (`postgres.ts:892`), the engine says `canceling statement due
 *   to statement timeout`, and `mapDatabaseError` matches `canceling statement`
 *   BEFORE its timeout branch (`errors.ts:280-293`) — so the timeout never arrives as
 *   `TimeoutError` on this engine at all. Narrowing the read is the repair that helps.
 *   The message that would distinguish an operator cancel is discarded by the mapper
 *   (`docs/BACKLOG.md` B4), so this cannot be split on text.
 *   FOR T7: a run cancellation must therefore be enforced by the run loop's own
 *   persisted state between tool calls, NOT by expecting a driver cancel to propagate
 *   out of this layer — after this commit it does not.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this split is only as sharp as `mapDatabaseError`'s classification,
 * which is SUBSTRING matching on the engine's message, and it is imprecise in BOTH
 * directions. Verified: `no such table: pooled_items` matches `pool` and arrives as
 * `PoolExhaustedError`, so a plainly repairable missing relation propagates and ends
 * the run; `Connection terminated unexpectedly` matches nothing, falls through to the
 * base class, and is offered to the model as a statement it could rewrite (bounded at
 * three attempts). Neither is a boundary failure — nothing runs that should not — and
 * neither is fixable here: the misreading happens before this layer sees the error.
 * Same root cause as `docs/BACKLOG.md` B4, which is where a real fix belongs.
 *
 * FOR T7, second: an error that PROPAGATES from this layer carries the driver's own
 * text unfenced, because it is an exception handed to server code rather than prompt
 * text. Anything that later renders one toward a model owes it `fenceUntrustedContent`,
 * which is otherwise applied to every engine message this module emits.

    What the tracker had charged this run BEFORE this execution, so a refusal below can
    say what this one cost it (#512).

    Read off the tracker rather than measured here with `context.clock`. The figure the
    meter owes a user is the one the ENFORCER charged against `maxTotalRunMs`, and a
    second measurement of the same span is a second number that can disagree with it —
    which is already the defect B13 records for the completed path, where the entry
    carries the engine's own elapsed time and the tracker charges the span around the
    whole call.

    A delta over a running total is only unambiguous while one execution of a run can
    be in flight, and it is: every agent workflow's budget freezes
    `maxConcurrentExecutions: 1` (`execution-policy.ts`, gated for every workflow by
    "runs one statement at a time: the loop is sequential"), and the policy pipeline
    DENIES a second call while `activeExecutions` has reached that ceiling, so no
    sibling can reach `endExecution` inside this span. `endRun` cannot land in it
    either — it refuses while an execution is live. Raise that ceiling above 1 and this
    delta becomes a sum over whatever settled alongside; read the tracker per execution
    then, rather than around the call. That premise is pinned by "a sibling execution's
    charge lands in the failed statement's span, which only maxConcurrentExecutions: 1
    rules out" (`tests/unit/lib/agent/tools.test.ts`), and the division of labour inside
    it is worth knowing before editing it: the body DEMONSTRATES the misattribution —
    charging the tracker from inside a failing execution and showing the 500 ms land on
    this figure — while what FAILS when the ceiling is raised is a value assertion over
    every workflow's budget, carrying that demonstration as its failure message. Under
    `maxConcurrentExecutions: 2` the arithmetic still passes, because the body charges the
    sibling directly and bypasses the policy gate; the message is what tells whoever
    raised it where to look.

    The named successor, for when this delta stops being worth defending:
    `executeAuditedOperation` already computes the failed execution's own charge and
    throws it away with the error. Carrying it — a module-level `WeakMap<object, number>`
    in `execution.ts` plus an exported reader, consulted here instead of subtracting —
    makes the figure correct under ANY concurrency, covers the `AgentCuratedReadError`
    site below as well, and retires the premise rather than asserting it, all without
    mutating the error object the "rethrown untouched" contract protects.

      Five `lfm2:24b` data-analysis runs, driven together: every one spent its three attempts on
      `no such column`, and not one produced a successful read. The run read in full had the
      CORRECT statement as its fourth, refused before it reached the database. The advice added
      earlier today is what makes those retries converge — the model went from repeating one

      about a REWRITE the model still has to author, and a rewrite is exactly what the budget of
      three exists to bound. A row-budget overrun in particular is the most expensive failure a run
      can produce: the statement ran to completion at the engine and returned rows before it blew
      the cap, and making it cheaper is not a correction anyone dictated.

    A catalog read that matched NO OBJECT is a refusal, not a result.

    Measured, and it is the server answering wrongly rather than the model asking wrongly.
    This repository's own `query-optimization` eval objective is "Why is the employee listing
    query slow?" — and there is no `employee_listing` object in the sample, because "employee
    listing" names a QUERY. Models called `inspect_schema` for it, the composed `sqlite_master`
    read matched nothing, and this function returned a COMPLETED step with `rowCount: 0` and a
    citable correlation id. The model then cited it, as it should be able to cite anything the
    server called a success, and `restsOnlyOnEmptyResults` scored the run `empty-evidence`.
    Three families produced character-identical ledgers doing exactly this: `gemma4:26b`,
    two models measured during evaluation.

    `profile_table` has had the right behaviour all along — it refuses a table the inventory
    does not list (`TABLE_NOT_INVENTORIED`) — and this is the same refusal for the same reason.

    What this deliberately does NOT refuse is an empty RESULT. `run_read_query` returning no
    rows has established something about the data, and this workflow family has a whole eval
    file about not treating that as a failure. The distinction is between a question about the
    data, which zero rows answers, and a question about the CATALOG, which zero objects does
    not: nothing was inspected, so there is nothing to cite.

    Only the model's own calls. A grounding read is the server asking, and an empty answer
    there is the honest state of a database with no tables — the drive reads that itself and
    says so in the opening note rather than being refused.

      Which empty answer this is, because the two mean opposite things.

      Zero rows from a COLUMN read means the object was not found — the case above. Zero rows
      from an index or relation read means the objects were found and carry none, which is an
      ANSWER to an optimization question rather than a failure of one. Telling a run "there is
      no object of that name" when it asked which indexes exist is false, and it sends the
      model hunting a misspelling it did not make.

      That is not a corner. `query-optimization`'s first rule ORDERS an index read, the sample
      database declares no `CREATE INDEX` anywhere, so the call returns zero rows every time:
      it is the opening turn of 79 of the 133 optimization runs measured, answered with a
      false sentence whose own advice cannot help, because the inventory it points at lists no
      indexes either. Since sampling went deterministic the dead opening became a dead
      certainty — `qwen3:8b` opened this way in 10 of 10 runs and lost all ten.

      Both stay refusals rather than becoming citable empty artifacts: that is the
      `empty-evidence` regression this function's docblock records, and nothing here reopens
      it. What changes is that the sentence is true.

/**
 * Calls the one curated method the reading names and projects what it returns.

 * oversight: `budget.statementTimeoutMs` cannot be enforced here. On the SQL path it
 * becomes PostgreSQL's `SET LOCAL statement_timeout`, because a statement is what is
 * being sent; `getSlowQueries(options?: {limit?})` and its five siblings take no
 * budget at all, so the deadline's clamp is ADVISORY on this path. What still binds
 * is everything else: the run deadline decides whether the call is admitted, the
 * statement budget counts it, and the row and byte caps are applied below by this
 * projection instead of by the engine.
 *
 * The two BOUNDS both REFUSE, and the only CUT there is was asked for. `maxResultRows`
 * and `maxResultBytes` are this run's ceilings rather than anything the model named, so
 * a reading that only fits under either once rows are dropped is refused — the same
 * promise the read path makes, where both `queryReadOnly` implementations throw on
 * either overrun — and a delivered result is therefore a complete one. A `limit` the model itself named BELOW
 * the ceiling is different in kind: it is a request, slicing to it answers exactly that
 * request, and the reading is delivered cut. A `limit` at or above the ceiling is not
 * the model's own bound — the cut would sit where the budget's cut sits — so it refuses
 * with the rest. Reporting a ceiling-sized slice as `rowCount` would publish a cap the
 * model reads as a count, which is the defect #513 closed, one reading over.
 *
 * `limit` and `schema` are applied HERE, to the projected rows, and not merely passed
 * to the provider. That is not defensive duplication: only `getActiveSessions` and
 * `getSlowQueries` take a limit at all, and four of the curated methods take no
 * options whatsoever, so a selector honoured only in the arguments would be a promise
 * the tool description makes and half the engines silently break — and it is what makes
 * the over-budget refusal's advice ("ask again with a smaller limit") something the
 * model can actually act on. Narrowing before bounding, because a limit applied to the

 * what `agent-data-analysis.1` counts. Without this, a run could present a
 * `sql.explain.estimate` artifact — the engine's DESCRIPTION of a statement, with no
 * data read, no rows and no measured duration — and satisfy the workflow's verdict
 * without ever having read the data it was opened to analyse.
 *
 * **A profile is excluded too, and that is a decision rather than a side effect.** A

 * it returns COUNTS the server composed from the run's own inventory rather than rows
 * the model asked for, so what would be shown is not an answer to the user's question
 * but an aggregate about a table; its statement is the server's, so there is nothing of
 * the model's to hand to an editor, which is why it could never have been presented
 * anyway (`statementBehind` returns null for it, and today that is the refusal it
 * gets); and its single aggregate row fails `CHART_TOO_FEW_ROWS` on every chart. So
 * admitting it would only change which refusal it is given — and the refusal it is
 * given now is the true one, which is the whole point of moving this check ahead of
 * the statement.
 *
 * The check goes BEFORE `statementBehind`, because a plan step DOES carry a drafted
 * statement: a check placed after it would have accepted the plan outright.
 *
 * One consequence, recorded rather than left to be discovered: the auto-execute gate's
 * first condition — "this run executed that exact statement" — can no longer FAIL from
 * this layer, because the only artifact presentable is a read whose own drafted
 * statement is by construction among `executedStatements`. Presenting a plan was the
 * one way to reach it. The condition stays in `auto-execute.ts` anyway: it is pure and
 * enumerated over every combination there, and a gate guarding an unbounded execution

    A statement carrying an optimizer directive takes no part in this join, on either

    statement, it is an instruction to the planner: the cheap indexed plan taken for
    the unhinted text says nothing about a statement whose hint forces a sequential
    scan, and the canonical form below normalises the difference away. So the gate
    would have passed condition 2 with a plan that is not the plan of the statement
    the editor will run — which is the whole of what condition 2 promises.

    Fixed HERE and deliberately not in `fingerprintStatement`. That function is the

    statement the ledger had already refused, with a comment added, would otherwise

    there would widen "the same statement" for repair accounting in the one direction
    that layer exists to close. The join is the only place the distinction matters,

    the run holds IS the hinted plan, and `inspect_plan` obtains that plan by sending
    the statement under an `EXPLAIN` prefix — whether `pg_hint_plan` still reads a
    hint from behind one is a property of an extension this repository does not ship,
    does not test against and cannot verify. The cost of refusing is that a hinted

    ONE answer per run, decided from the run's own ledger (#373 review).

    The tool is non-terminal — only `compose_report` ends the loop — so nothing stopped
    a model calling it twice, and the second call was as successful as the first: two
    `answer-composed` entries, two statements the rail delivered to the editor, and on
    an auto-execute run BOTH of them run there without a timeout, under a checkbox that
    promised the final answer. The verdict reads the same ledger and is satisfied by
    one entry, so the second was never buying anything either.

    Refused BEFORE the arguments are parsed, and that order is the point: an
    `INVALID_TOOL_INPUT` would invite the model to correct its arguments and call
    again, which is the loop this refusal exists to end. Nothing about the arguments is
    wrong here — the run is.

    It costs no repair attempt, because this tool reaches neither the repair ledger nor
    a database: `runAuditedAgentCall` is where an attempt is spent, and no path from
    here enters it. The run loop settles this as an ordinary `answered` outcome, the
    same way it settles every other refusal a ledger-only tool gives.

    The consequence across a resumed drive is deliberate rather than incidental: the
    entry is durable, so a run resumed after answering is told it has answered rather
    than being allowed to answer again for a second hand-over.
