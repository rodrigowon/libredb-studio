/**
 * The run's outcome, rendered once at the top of the rail.
 *
 * What these tests pin is the property that makes the card safe to add at all: it is a
 * SECOND rendering of entries the ledger already holds, so every claim on it has to be
 * traceable to one. They are therefore written over `foldLedgerEntries` rather than over
 * hand-built timeline objects — a hand-built one can say something no ledger produces,
 * which is exactly the failure mode the card is meant not to have.
 *
 * Three of them are correctness rather than presentation:
 *
 *  - **`Apply to editor` keeps the accessible name `applyStatementName` builds.** That
 *    name carries the guard's marks (WCAG 2.5.3), and the whole point of moving the
 *    control up here is that it must not lose them on the way.
 *  - **On an engine whose statements are not SQL there is no read-only chip.** Nothing
 *    read the statement, so a green chip would be a claim no code in this product made.
 *  - **A statement is never painted as SQL unless something says it is.** The tint
 *    follows `tab-language.ts`, and where no capabilities are to hand it follows the
 *    guard's own reach rather than defaulting to SQL.

  A run CAN end `failed` holding what it produced, and the shape is not a corner case:

  drafted statement BEFORE `service.finish`, and it is called with `"failed"` for a
  model timeout, an exhausted deadline and the turn ceiling. `run-finished`'s own
  documentation names the combination — "`failed` having answered nothing (the turn
  ceiling)" is one axis, and the product on the ledger is the other.

  So the status is not what decides which card this is. The ledger's product decides,
  and the failure is stated beside it: a card that read the status first replaced a
  drafted statement, its marked hand-off, the guard's claims and the chips with a
