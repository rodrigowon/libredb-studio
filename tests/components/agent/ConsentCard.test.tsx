/**
 * The hand-over consent step, as its own component (spec Deliverable 4).
 *
 * It decides exactly what the inline section in `AgentRail.tsx` decided: whether the
 * run's final statement also lands in the user's editor and runs there. So the things
 * these tests pin are the things that made that section correct, and none of them are
 * presentational:
 *
 *  - **the tick is OFF unless the caller says otherwise**, because a widening that is
 *    on by default is not consented to;
 *  - **`autoExecuteTerms` is the accessible description of the checkbox**, and stays
 *    one after it moved into a popover. A description that is only rendered when a
 *    popover is open is a description a screen-reader user is never given, so the node
 *    is always in the DOM and the popover only unhides it;
 *  - **the figures are DERIVED** — the chips read `AGENT_HANDOVER_BUDGET`, so a change
 *    to the budget cannot leave the copy behind (#425's lesson);
 *  - **the SQLite sentence is read off the engine the start was decided on**, keeps its
 *    exact words, and does not wait for the tick: it is true of the run either way;
 *  - **focus moves into the region when it is raised**, which is the announcement a
 *    keyboard user gets that two buttons appeared under a Start that just went
 *    disabled.
