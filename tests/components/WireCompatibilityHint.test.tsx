/**
 * The hint answers one user question - "I have MariaDB, which of these fourteen
 * buttons do I press?" - so the tests assert what a user can read, not markup.
 *
 * The registry is mocked rather than read, because the real one is data that
 * changes every time a probe lands (#424 Phase 0). A component test that asserts
 * on today's registry contents would fail on the next probe and teach the next
 * maintainer to delete it.
 *
 * "ExampleStore" is deliberately not a real product. An earlier version used TiDB,
 * which reads as a probe result to anyone skimming - and a fixture that names a real
 * engine states a tier for it, which only a probe may do. (TiDB has since been probed
 * and is a real registry entry, at a tier this fixture does not claim.)
