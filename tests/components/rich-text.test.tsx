/**
 * Fenced code blocks in model prose (#389).
 *
 * The gap these pin: plan mode is toolless, so its ENTIRE output is one block of model
 * prose, and a plan for anything worth planning contains SQL. `renderProse` read
 * headings, bullets, bold and inline code and deliberately not fences, so the SQL
 * arrived as a paragraph of literal backticks with its whitespace collapsed — the one
 * thing the mode produces, rendered as the one thing this renderer would not read.
 *
 * The security property of the block still holds and is pinned here too: a fence is
 * rendered as text nodes inside a `pre`, so nothing in it reaches an HTML parser.

/**
 * A block a surface beside this prose is already showing verbatim (L2, L5).
 *
 * Measured in Chrome on 2026-08-21: a plan run's closing prose HOLDS the fenced
 * statement, so every surface that rendered that prose reprinted the statement — the
 * answer card showed the statement, then the same statement again inside its own
 * `Why this statement` fold, and the transcript entry below printed it a third time,
 * each copy with its own clipboard.
 *
 * So the caller may name the ONE block it is already showing, and that block is not
 * printed a second time. It is the same shape the per-block editor control's
 * suppression already has — the caller says what the surface beside it is offering —
 * and it is deliberately keyed on the TEXT rather than on a flag: the recorded
 * deliverable is read out of the prose by `readPlanStatement`, which joins and trims
 * the fence's lines exactly as this does, so the block that matches is the block the
 * ledger took.
 *
 * What is NOT suppressed is the prose. Every other fence still renders, and `Copy all`
 * — which takes the string the model wrote, not this rendering of it — still carries
 * the whole text including the block that was not printed.
