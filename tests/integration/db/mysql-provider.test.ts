 * fixture is then a test of the mock - which is how the health read asking for
 * `LEFT(sql_text, 100)` passed 100% line coverage and two reviews (#512).
 *
 * Evaluated in `recordCall`, the ONE funnel every fixture in this file goes through -
 * named, delegating and inline alike - so a fixture added tomorrow cannot opt out of it.
 *
 * Each rule is a MEASURED refusal, never a guess: a rule that refuses what a server
 * answers is the same defect with its sign flipped. `sql_text` is not a column of
 * `events_statements_summary_by_digest` on any build - 1054 / ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR /
 * 42S22 on MySQL 26.7.0, Percona Server 8.4.11-11 and MariaDB 12.3.2, with
 * `@@performance_schema` 1 and 0 alike (see `sqlTextRefusal()` below and
 * `docs/providers/mysql.md`).
 *
 * The MATCH is wider than that measurement, on purpose and worth knowing: it is a
 * co-occurrence over the whole statement, so any statement naming the digest table and
 * `sql_text` anywhere trips it - including one shape a real server WOULD answer, a join
 * of the digest table against `events_statements_current`, which does have `SQL_TEXT`.
 * Nothing `mysql.ts` emits has that shape, so the over-match costs nothing today. The
 * day a statement does, narrow this rule to a `sql_text` reference bound to the digest
 * table; do not add an exception, which is the sign flipped a second time.
 *
 * There is one rule, so this list stays in this file. Lift it to `tests/helpers/` when a
 * SECOND engine has a measured refusal of its own - not before: the other fourteen
 * provider test files would receive an empty rule list, which proves nothing about their
 * fixtures and reads as coverage.

 * `EXPLAIN JSON`, `OPTIMIZE TABLE` and `CHECK TABLE` there, StarRocks 3.3 loses its
 * overview to the same cause, and MySQL 26.7.0 itself rejects `CHECK TABLE` - all
 * measured 2026-08-24, both ways over one connection.

 * So a statement with no parameters goes over the text protocol and a statement
 * with parameters keeps the prepared one - the placeholders are what the prepared
 * protocol is for, and nothing else changes about how a bind value reaches the
