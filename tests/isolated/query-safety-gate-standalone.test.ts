// ── The standalone execution path against the REAL confirmation gate (#297) ──
//
// Isolated, and this is the whole reason the file exists: tests/hooks/
// use-query-execution.test.ts stubs `@/components/QuerySafetyDialog` with
// `mock.module`, which is process-wide in bun, so no test that shares a process
// with it can observe what the real predicate answers. That stub is deliberate -
// it is what lets that file's UPDATE and DDL cases execute without a
// confirmation - but it also means the standalone path's half of #297 cannot be
// proved there: the stub answers on a substring, so a test written against it
// would pass with the fix reverted.
//
// The embedded adapter needs no such file (tests/hooks/use-query-adapter.test.ts
// already uses the real predicate). This one covers the other path: a script
// whose reading cannot be resolved must reach the dialog rather than the server,
// with nothing between the gate and the assertion.
