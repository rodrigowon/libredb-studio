/**
 * The eval harness (#330 T1): what drives one scripted investigation to a ledger,
 * and reads that ledger back.
 *
 * The measuring instrument this milestone needed, and the reason it is first in
 * #330's order. Nine live runs on 2026-08-12 (#341) ended with every gate green and
 * not one report between them; what was missing was not a test but a REQUIREMENT,
 * and a requirement about model behaviour can only be enforced by something that
 * exercises model behaviour.
 *
 * Two rules shape it, both learned rather than chosen:
 *
 *  - **A scenario asserts against a LEDGER, not against prose.** The existing suite
 *    had one test touching this and it asserted the model's text was returned to
 *    the CALLER — a correct test of the wrong thing, because a user reads the
 *    ledger. `EvalDrive` therefore exposes the folded events, the statements that
 *    reached the database, and the goal verdict; the driver's return value is one
 *    field among them rather than the subject.
 *  - **A "restart" is a genuinely second set of in-memory objects** over the same
 *    data directory. `EvalRun.drive` builds a new store, service, budget tracker,
 *    artifact store, deadline and repair ledger every time, so a resumed run can
 *    only know what the previous one wrote down. Nothing is carried across by
 *    reference.
 *
 * The database is scripted rather than real: these scenarios measure the MODEL's
 * strategy, and a real engine would make the same scenario answer differently on
 * two machines. `tests/isolated/agent-investigation-e2e.test.ts` is where real
 * engines are driven, and it stays that way.
 *
 * Nothing here registers a `mock.module`. Files importing this must not share a
 * process with a suite that stubs `@/lib/llm/types`, `@/lib/agent/model-adapter` or
 * `@/lib/agent/provider-registry`.

/**
 * The statements the MODEL asked for, after the drive's own catalog reads.
 *
 * The prefix is VERIFIED rather than assumed: a bare `slice` would also return an
 * empty list for a run that never reached the database, so an assertion of `[]`
 * would pass both for a run that did exactly the right thing and for one that did
 * nothing at all. A drive that reused its run's recorded inventory reads no catalog,
 * which is why the expected prefix is only consumed while it matches.
 */
/**
 * The same subtraction for a drive that is not in agent mode.
 *
 * A planning drive reaches the database too since the grounding design of
 * 2026-08-15, so `[]` is no longer what one sends and attributing its grounding reads
 * to the MODEL would make every planning eval assert the opposite of what it means.
 *
 * By marker rather than by ordered prefix, because how many statements a plan run's
 * grounding costs depends on which of three paths grounded it — its own ledger, the
 * inventory this process already held, or a fresh capture — and a prefix would pin
 * which path ran. The cost is that a MODEL statement naming one of these catalogs
 * would be subtracted too; a planning model has no tools and sends none, so there is
 * no such statement to lose, and whether a drive was grounded at all is asserted on
 * its ledger and its transcript where it is visible directly.
