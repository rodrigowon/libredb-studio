/**
 * The capstone (#329 T14, epic #325): one whole investigation, driven twice, against
 * engines that really answer.
 *
 * Every other agent suite substitutes something for the database. `tools.ts`'s unit
 * tests hand the tool layer a spy `queryReadOnly`; `agent-investigation.test.ts` does
 * the same so it can assert what the loop DECIDES without an engine's opinions in the
 * way. Both are the right shape for what they prove, and neither can prove the thing
 * this file exists for: that the arc works when the answers come from a real engine —
 * a real error text, a real catalog, real rows, real column names.
 *
 * So nothing here is stubbed between the run loop and the engine:
 *
 *  - **The provider is acquired through the production seam.** The acquirer is
 *    `acquireExecutionProfileProvider` (`src/lib/db/factory.ts`), the same function
 *    T9's routes hand the loop, so the provider is opened under the agent read-only
 *    profile with its role verification and its `PRAGMA query_only` — not constructed
 *    here with the right-looking arguments.
 *  - **SQLite is a real temporary database file**, seeded through a writable provider
 *    and then read through a second, profiled one, the way
 *    `tests/integration/db/sqlite-provider.test.ts` does it. Its catalog rows are
 *    whatever `sqlite_master` holds, and its failure text is whatever the engine says.
 *  - **PostgreSQL is the suite's engine fixture**, meaning the technique
 *    `tests/integration/db/postgres-provider.test.ts` established: `mock.module("pg")`
 *    in front of a stateful in-process server double, so `PostgresProvider` runs
 *    unmodified — its `BEGIN READ ONLY` envelope, its extended-protocol statement, its
 *    `ROLLBACK`/`DISCARD ALL`. CI runs no PostgreSQL service (`docs/BACKLOG.md` A5),
 *    and that is recorded rather than papered over. Be exact about the split: what is
 *    REAL on this side is the PROVIDER and its envelope; the catalog rows, the result
 *    rows AND the `relation "ordrs" does not exist` refusal are all scripted, written
 *    to PostgreSQL's own wording and SQLSTATE. Only the SQLite half gets a failure text
 *    an engine genuinely produced.
 *  - **The model is the ratified provider package** over a scripted transport, as in
 *    the sibling suites: a stubbed model would prove the loop calls what it calls, not
 *    that the transcript it builds is one an SDK will send.
 *
 * The arc is the acceptance bar's, beat for beat: a drafted statement, a failure on a
 * wrong identifier, a repair informed by the schema tool, a verified statement, stored
 * artifacts, and a report whose claims cite them.
 *
 * One honest limit on how far "end to end" reaches: the tool resources below are
 * composed by hand, in parallel with `src/lib/agent/runtime.ts`, because that module
 * exports no composer to reuse. So a production wiring change that stays
 * type-compatible — a differently clocked deadline, another tracker — would not
 * surface here. What this file pins is the RUN, not the composition root; `runtime.ts`
 * has its own suite for that.
 *
 * Own test group, not part of Group 0f: this file mocks `pg`, and `mock.module` is
 * process-wide.
