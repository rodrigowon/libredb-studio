/**
 * The investigation workflow (#329 T7b): the loop that turns one objective into a
 * run, and — the milestone criterion — survives the process that was driving it
 * dying mid-flight.
 *
 * Three things about the setup are deliberate rather than convenient:
 *
 *  - The ledger is a REAL `@workflow/world-local` over a real temporary
 *    directory, and a "restart" is a genuinely second set of in-memory objects
 *    (store, service, budget tracker, artifact store, deadline, repair ledger)
 *    opened over the same files. Nothing is carried across by reference, so a
 *    resumed run can only know what the previous process wrote down.
 *  - The model is the REAL ratified provider package driven over a scripted
 *    `fetch`, as in `agent-capability-probe.test.ts`. A stubbed model would prove
 *    that the loop calls what it calls; it could not prove that the transcript a
 *    resumed run rebuilds is one an SDK will actually send.
 *  - The database is the real M1 pipeline down to a spy `queryReadOnly`. That spy
 *    is the instrument for "no tool execution is performed twice": after a restart
 *    it must not be reached again for work the ledger already records.
 *
 * Shares Group 0f for the same reason the other agent model tests do: it maps SDK
 * failures onto the REAL `@/lib/llm` error classes, which `tests/api/ai/*.test.ts`
 * replaces process-wide with stubs.

/*
  THE INVARIANT THIS BLOCK PINS MOVED, deliberately, on 2026-08-15.

  It used to be "planning mode performs zero database operations", and every test in
  it asserted that no provider was ever acquired. `docs/superpowers/specs/
  2026-08-15-plan-mode-sql-generator-design.md` changed that on the owner's decision,
  for a reason a live run made concrete: a plan run could only be about a real
  database when an AGENT run had already read one on the same connection in the same
  process, so the safe mode's usefulness was conditional on having used the unsafe
  one. Asked about a real six-table database, plan mode named none of them.

  What the product actually sells is narrower than "reaches nothing", and it is what
  these tests assert now:

   - a planning run runs NO STATEMENT OF THE USER'S. It reads the catalog — which is
     what the sidebar does on every connect — and nothing else.
   - the MODEL stays toolless. Grounding is the server's work, not a capability
     handed to the model, so the tool set on every planning turn is still empty.
   - nothing is written, and every statement it drafts is handed to the user to run.

  `userStatements` below is the instrument: it fails loudly on any statement that is
  not one of the server's own grounding reads, so a future change that let a planning
  run send something of the model's cannot pass by asserting a count.

    The workflow a plan run was NOT grounded for until #411, and the exclusion it lost.

    The premise was that an operations objective is not about the schema. That is true
    about the QUESTION and false about the evidence: the engine's own reports are full
    of schema identifiers, and a run that has never seen the inventory reads them as
    opaque strings. So an operations plan is grounded like every other workflow now,
    and what stays workflow-specific is what is PACKED — names and indexes, no columns
    and no relations — and what is asked of it, which is still prose.

    Its sentence is still its own rather than the agent mode's, because
    `OPERATIONS_CONTEXT_NOTE` tells the model to take readings with `inspect_operations`
    and a planning run has no tools at all: naming one it does not have is the #350
    failure. Both halves are asserted, since the note being merely PRESENT would pass

    The invariant the whole shape of #411 rests on: the CAPTURE stays whole, and only
    the presentation varies.

    `holdSnapshotForConnection` shares one reading between runs, and `context-snapshot.ts`
    states that an inventory is all-or-nothing because "an inventory missing its keys
    while claiming to be whole is worse than no inventory". So an operations-shaped
    partial capture would be handed to a LATER run of another workflow as if it were
    complete. Nothing pinned that until review asked for it: a change that made the
    operations capture operations-shaped — the exact temptation the design bans — would
    have left every other test in this change green.

    Grounding a plan run fixes what it knows; it does not fix what it hands back. The
    contract it was given until 2026-08-15 — "answer with a plan in prose: what you
    would inspect, in what order, and what each step would establish" — asks for a
    lecture, and a lecture is what the live run of that date produced against a real
    six-table database. Grounding it without rewriting this would have produced the
    same numbered inspection plan with real table names in it.

    So the deliverable is now ONE runnable statement, or an explicit refusal, and both
    halves are asserted here because the failure mode is the same either way: a run
    that answers with generic advice as though advice were an answer.

      WHICH ENGINE the plan is about, and why the prose deliverable is the one that was
      never told.

      Every statement plan carries its engine already: `planningStatementContract` takes
      the connection type and spends it on the fence tag, so a plan that writes SQL is
      writing it for a named dialect. The prose plan took no type at all — and
      `operations` is the only workflow whose deliverable is prose, so a plan-mode
      Operate run was the one plan run in the product that was never told which engine
      it was planning against.

      Found by driving the built branch in Chrome after #411, which is what makes it
      worth pinning here rather than reasoning about. Grounding made these plans
      SPECIFIC without making them right: a grounded plan on a SQLite connection named
      the eight real tables of the inventory and then proposed reading
      `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_total_relation_size`, and an ungrounded plan on a
      Redis connection correctly said it could name no object and then proposed wait
      event statistics, lock management views and a blocking chain dependency tree.
      Redis has no locks and no wait events; SQLite has neither of those views. The
      confident half of the answer was about a different database engine.

      Naming the type is measurably not enough on its own: `planningUngroundedNote`
      already interpolates "on this redis connection" and that run still proposed lock
      trees. So the rule asserted here is about the READINGS — that a named one must be
      one this engine offers — and it is asserted on both the grounded and the
      ungrounded path, because the live defect appeared on one of each.

/*
  A presentation the model SERIALIZED, driven through the real SDK (#406).

  `tests/unit/lib/agent/tools.test.ts` calls `presentAnswerTool` directly, so every
  one of its cases enters the tool with whatever object the test wrote. That is not
  the path a model's arguments take. Between the wire and the tool sits `streamText`,
  which validates the model's arguments against the SAME `inputSchema`
  `declaredTools()` handed it — and that schema, correctly, does not accept a string
  where the presentation object belongs. Measured against `ai@7.0.59`: it throws
  `InvalidToolInputError` at `doParseToolCall`, CATCHES it, re-parses the raw JSON
  without a schema and enqueues the tool-call part anyway with `invalid: true`, plus a
  `tool-error` part and its own `role: "tool"` result message.

  So the serialized presentation reaches `readSerializedPresentation` only because of
  two properties of `takeTurn` that nothing else names: it pushes every `tool-call`
  part without consulting `part.invalid` (src/lib/agent/investigation.ts:1042), and it
  keeps only `role: "assistant"` response messages, discarding the SDK's error result
  (src/lib/agent/investigation.ts:1069). Hardening the first to
  `part.invalid !== true` — the shape `capability-probe.ts:279` already uses, so it is
  a natural edit rather than a hypothetical one — deletes #406's entire behaviour
  gain: the call is dropped, the turn looks like "the model stopped", and the run is
  scored with no answer and nothing on the ledger saying why.

  Measured by applying that edit: 7 of this file's 83 tests fail with it, and none of
  the other six was watching THIS. They all sit on the REFUSAL path — a malformed
  argument list must come back as a typed `INVALID_TOOL_INPUT`, and an unoffered tool
  as "no such tool" — where an invalid call being dropped instead of dispatched costs
  the model its explanation. The success path, where a call the SDK flags is
  nevertheless one the tool can serve, had no test at all before this one, and it is
  the only path #406 exists to buy.

    `AGENT_REPORT_REMINDER_NOTICE` already tells them to report, and what they did next
    is why a notice is not enough — reminded and still holding the whole set, they went
    back to reading, repeated a refused selector, or wrote strategy about varying one.

    So the reminded turn narrows the choice instead of repeating the instruction.

    WHAT IT NARROWS TO is the part measured today rather than carried over. An earlier
    version left `compose_report` alone, and this measurement shows what that costs: the
    assessment verifier requires a `table-profiled` event and the optimization verifier a
    plan comparison, so a run narrowed to the report alone on those surfaces cannot clear
    its own bar — it would trade `no-report` for `no-table-profile`, which is a different
    failure and not a smaller one. The narrowed set is therefore the report PLUS whatever
    that workflow's verdict requires, which turns the mechanism from a muzzle into a
    funnel: the run can only do the two or three things it is judged on.

    above. Its investigate cell read 5/5 at 9 seconds; on a later serving engine it reads 1/5,
    and four of the five losses spend the WHOLE turn without invoking a single tool before the
    clock ends them — 90 seconds, empty ledger, `no-report`. The passing runs still finish in 9.
    Bimodal: it either answers at once or thinks until the wall.

    That is the same illness `suppressPlanReasoning` was measured on and the same remedy, on a
    surface that setting deliberately does not reach. So it is a SECOND switch rather than a
    widening of the first: a model measured needing quiet on plan was not measured needing it
    while holding tools, and reading one field for both would move cells nobody re-measured.

    Off by default, like its sibling, and for the reason its sibling records: a drive-wide change
    here is how this repository has twice handed back cells it had already won.
