/**
 * The evidence the removal of the legacy AI panels rests on (#331 T7).
 *
 * M4 deleted the NL2SQL panel and the AI Autopilot panel on the argument that the
 * agent covers what they did (#331 T2, PR #349). That argument was an opinion. This
 * file is the half of it that can be measured: the two panels' HAPPY PATHS, driven
 * through the run loop as agent runs and asserted against the LEDGER — the event
 * kinds, the statements that reached the database, the findings the server derived
 * and the goal verdict — rather than against what a mock returned.
 *
 * The other half is the honest one and it is not omitted: the last describe block
 * asserts what these runs CANNOT do that the panels did, in the same vocabulary, and
 * `docs/AGENT.md` § "What the removed AI panels did that a run does not" carries the
 * whole list with the code that proves each entry. An uncovered scenario is a reason
 * somebody had for keeping a surface, so it is recorded as a finding rather than left
 * out of the measurement.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT re-asserted here, because they are asserted where they belong and
 * a second copy is a second thing to keep true:
 *
 *  - a recommendation is recorded and never executed — `query-optimization.test.ts`
 *  - a profile sends counts and returns no value — `database-assessment.test.ts`
 *  - the citation the server offers is one the server accepts — `report-citation.test.ts`
 *  - what a real model does with any of this — `real-model.ts`, which needs a key
