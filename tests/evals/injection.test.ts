/**
 * Prompt-injection fixtures (#330 T4).
 *
 * `untrusted-content.ts` fences database content; these are what prove the fence
 * holds. Every vector here is text an ATTACKER CAN WRITE — a table name, a column
 * name, a row value, an engine error message — carrying the closing marker and an
 * instruction, which is the text-level version of SQL injection: end the fenced
 * region and everything after it reads as the server's own prose.
 *
 * The gate is stated in two halves, and both are asserted for every vector:
 *
 *  1. **Neutralised, never removed.** The marker is defanged and stays legible,
 *     because the content is EVIDENCE — a silently edited result would make what the
 *     model reads disagree with the rows the artifact store holds.
 *  2. **No tool escalation.** Whatever the injected text asks for, the run's
 *     permissions do not move: a write is refused by the statement guard before the
 *     database, a tool that was never offered does not exist for that run, and a
 *     claim citing something the run never read cannot be composed.
 *
 * The envelope check is the sharp one. Counting markers proves the property
 * directly: every block the SERVER writes holds as many closing markers as it
 * opened, whatever the database returned.
 *
 * The last block of this file is the exception, and it is an OPEN RISK rather than
 * a proof: an assistant message can carry an unfenced marker with attacker text
 * after it (`docs/BACKLOG.md` B29). It is stated here rather than elsewhere because
 * these fixtures are what found it.

  /*
    Found by this suite, and corrected by review on #346 after it was first written
    down as a bounded residual. It is not bounded, and the reasoning that said it was
    is worth recording because it was wrong in an instructive way.

    The claim was: "the text after the marker is the model's own JSON, not attacker
    content". That is false. An attacker who can name a table controls the WHOLE
    identifier, so they control the marker AND arbitrary text after it; JSON quoting
    around it does not make that suffix the model's. Replayed inside an assistant
    message, it is unfenced attacker text following a closing marker.

    What IS true, and is the reason this is not trivially exploitable today, is a
    different thing entirely: the server never hands the model the raw marker. Every
    server-authored path neutralises it first, so the model reading a hostile
    inventory sees the defanged spelling. For the raw marker to reach an assistant
    message, the model has to RECONSTRUCT it — which the first test below shows it is
    not given the means to do, and the second shows is nonetheless not prevented.
