/*
  A tool has TWO contracts, and only one of them is written down deliberately.

  The runtime contract is what `inputSchema.safeParse` refuses. The ADVERTISED contract is the
  JSON Schema the SDK derives from that same object and puts in front of the model — and the two
  are derived differently enough to disagree. Measured on this tree over every entry of
  `AGENT_TOOL_DEFINITIONS`: a `z.preprocess` wrapper produces a `ZodPipe`, and in input mode a
  `ZodPipe` is not counted as a required key, so `present_answer` refused a call missing
  `presentation` while advertising `artifact` as its only required key.

  That gap is not a cosmetic one. `present_answer` is a ledger-only tool whose refusal records no
  event, so a model that OBEYS the advertised contract is refused with `INVALID_TOOL_INPUT`, the
  run is scored `no-answer`, and the ledger holds nothing that says why — the same invisible
  failure the serialized-presentation fix above exists to remove, re-created for correct models
  instead of sloppy ones.

  Asserted over EVERY tool rather than over `present_answer`, because the invariant is what
  protects the next tool: whatever a future schema is built from, a key the runtime demands has to
  be a key the model was told to send. Both sets are derived from the schema itself, never listed
  here, so a new tool joins the assertion by existing — as a no-op for the key-by-key half if it
  requires nothing (`inspect_schema` is that case today: every field optional, so both sets are
  empty), which is why the io-pair half below is not redundant with it.

  Two assertions per tool, because neither one alone is the invariant:

  - The KEY-BY-KEY one compares the required keys of the two contracts, and it is the half that
    names the failure in the reader's own terms ("advertises X but refuses Y"). It reads the top
    level only, deliberately: a nested issue is a shape complaint about a key that WAS sent, so
    counting it would report keys the runtime never demanded. The cost is that it sees exactly one
    level — measured with the old wrapper moved one level down, its two sets agree while the parser
    really does refuse `outer.inner`.
  - The IO-PAIR one covers every depth and names nothing. `io: "input"` and `io: "output"` differ
    only where a transform sits between them, so two identical renderings prove there is no
    transform ANYWHERE in the tree, nested or not. Measured: on this tree the pair is identical for
    all nine tools; with the `z.preprocess` wrapper in place exactly one tool's pair differs, and
    the same wrapper at depth two also differs while the key-by-key half stays green.

    It is a ban on transforms rather than a detector of the dangerous direction, and that is a
    deliberate over-reach: `.default()` would also trip it, though it errs the safe way (the model
    is told a key is optional and the parser accepts its omission). No tool schema here uses one.
    A tool that wants a default should say `.optional()` and apply the fallback in the tool body,
    where the reader can see it — the alternative is teaching this test to tell the two directions
    apart, which buys a weaker invariant than "these schemas do not transform".

      `profile_table` and `compose_report` and takes that tool away.

      `TABLE_NOT_INVENTORIED` kept saying "Call inspect_schema for it first". So the sequence
      a measured assessment run walks is: held and narrowed, asked for a profile, names a
      table slightly wrong, told to call a tool it no longer holds, calls it, and is told
      there is no such tool. Two refusals in a row, neither of them actionable.

      The inventory is right there, so the refusal now offers from it. Naming real tables is
      also the more useful answer in an un-narrowed run, which is why this is not gated on
