# Component test runner with mock isolation groups.
#
# bun's mock.module() is process-wide, so when one test file mocks a module,
# every other file in the same bun process sees the mock instead of the real
# module. This script groups test files so that no file runs in the same
# process as a file that mocks its component module.
#
# Grouping rationale:
#   Group 1 — Studio.test.tsx (mocks sidebar, schema-explorer, QueryEditor,
#             studio/index, ConnectionModal, CommandPalette, SchemaDiagram,
#             DataProfiler, CodeGenerator, TestDataGenerator, CreateTableModal,
#             SaveQueryModal, etc.)
#   Group 2 — Sidebar.test.tsx (mocks ConnectionsList, schema-explorer)
#   Group 3 — BottomPanel.test.tsx (mocks ResultsGrid, QueryHistory,
#             DataCharts, SchemaDiff, SavedQueries, VisualExplain, etc.)
#   Group 4 — AdminDashboard shell + admin section/layout/index pages
#   Group 5 — SecurityTab.test.tsx (mocks MaskingSettings)
#   Group 6 — All remaining files (safe together — only mock libraries,
#             ui primitives, or sub-components with no test files)
