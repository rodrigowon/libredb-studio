## 1. Overview

MySQL is a relational database and maps onto the `DatabaseProvider` interface much like PostgreSQL.
It extends the shared `SQLBaseProvider` (identifier quoting with backticks, automatic `LIMIT`
injection, `?` placeholders, cloud SSL auto-detection) and layers MySQL-specific introspection and
monitoring on top of `mysql2`.

The most useful way to read this doc is **as a diff against the [PostgreSQL provider](./postgres.md)**,
which is the SQL reference implementation. The headline differences:

| Aspect | PostgreSQL | MySQL |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Schema introspection | One `MATERIALIZED`-CTE round-trip + two-phase (`getSchemaList`/`getSchemaRelations`) | Single `getSchema()`, **N+1** (1 + 3 queries per table), **no** two-phase split |
| Schema scope | All non-system schemas, cross-schema FKs | **Single database** (`TABLE_SCHEMA = <db>`), bare table names |
| Maintenance ops | `vacuum`, `analyze`, `reindex`, `kill` | `analyze`, `optimize`, `check`, `kill` |
| Query timeout | `statement_timeout` from `queryTimeout` | **Not wired** — no server-side query timeout |
| Pool config honored | `min`/`max`/`idleTimeout`/`acquireTimeout` | **`max` only** (`connectionLimit`) |
| Queries-per-second metric | `undefined` (needs sampling) | Reported (`Queries`/`Uptime`) |
| BLOB/binary values | driver-native | driver-native ([§3.3](#33-blob--binary-values-reach-every-surface-as-bytes)) |

### 1.1 MariaDB and the other MySQL-protocol engines

This provider is what a MariaDB connection uses: there is no `mariadb` type id, and choosing MySQL in
the connection dialog is the documented way to reach it. `mysql2` speaks the protocol both servers
share, and the connection dialog's `WireCompatibilityHint` names the engines this driver has been
measured against. The full per-engine table is in [`README.md`](./README.md#wire-compatible-engines);
two behaviours belong here because they are this provider's code, not the engine's.

**The overview does not rename the server.** `VERSION()` is the only thing that says which engine
answered. MySQL returns a bare number (`8.0.35`), so `labelServerVersion()` supplies the vendor;
MariaDB, TiDB, Vitess and OceanBase return a build string that already names themselves
(`12.3.2-MariaDB-ubu2404`), and that string is passed through unchanged. Prefixing it would assert a
vendor the server never claimed. StarRocks and SingleStore are deliberately not in that list: both
answer with a plain MySQL number and give nothing to key on.

**`performance_schema` is OFF by default on MariaDB.** Measured on `mariadb:12.3`
(`@@performance_schema` = 0, build `12.3.2-MariaDB-ubu2404`): the `performance_schema` tables exist,
so the metric queries do not fail — they return a row of NULLs. Cache-hit ratio, queries/sec and
buffer-pool usage are therefore absent rather than zero. The digest table behaves the same way: it is
selectable and answers **0 rows**, so the slow-query list is empty rather than an error — re-measured
2026-08-27, and true of the health line only since the fix below, which is what made the OFF state
distinguishable from a broken read at all. `information_schema`, `PROCESSLIST`, `EXPLAIN
FORMAT=JSON`, schema introspection, sizes and row counts are unaffected. Start the server with
`performance_schema=ON` to get the monitoring figures.

The one metric that goes the other way is `deadlocks`: it comes from `SHOW STATUS LIKE
'Innodb_deadlocks'`, which MariaDB publishes and MySQL does not, so it is the single performance
figure a default MariaDB reports and a MySQL server does not.

---

## 2. Architecture

Same Strategy-Pattern hierarchy as the other SQL providers:

```
DatabaseProvider (interface) → BaseDatabaseProvider → SQLBaseProvider → MySQLProvider
```

`MySQLProvider` inherits the shared SQL helpers from
[`sql-base.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/sql-base.ts) — see the
[PostgreSQL doc §2.2](./postgres.md#22-what-sqlbaseprovider-provides) for the full table. The two
that matter most here:

- **`escapeIdentifier()`** quotes MySQL identifiers with **backticks** (`` `ident` ``), doubling any
  embedded backtick.
- **`prepareQuery()`** injects `LIMIT` into bare `SELECT`s; the underlying `analyzeQuery()` also
  understands MySQL's `LIMIT offset, count` syntax (see [§5.2](#52-automatic-limit-injection)).

### Registration

Loaded on demand by the factory ([`factory.ts:67`](../../src/lib/db/factory.ts)):

```ts
case 'mysql': {
  const { MySQLProvider } = await import('./providers/sql/mysql');
  return new MySQLProvider(connection, options);
}
```

---

## 3. Design decisions

### 3.1 N+1 schema introspection (no MATERIALIZED CTEs, no two-phase split)

Unlike PostgreSQL, `getSchema()` ([mysql.ts:326](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)) runs one
query for the table list and then **three queries per table** (columns, foreign keys, indexes) —
the classic `1 + N*3` pattern. MySQL also does **not** implement `getSchemaList()` /
`getSchemaRelations()`, so the two-phase fast-tree loading that PostgreSQL uses is unavailable; the
`/api/db/schema/list` route falls back to the single `getSchema()`. On a very large schema this is
more round-trips than the Postgres approach — see [Known limitations](#14-known-limitations--future-work).

### 3.2 Single-database scope

Every introspection query is parameterized with `TABLE_SCHEMA = ?` bound to `config.database`. MySQL
"schemas" *are* databases, so the provider only ever sees the connected database, and table display
names are bare (no `schema.table` prefixing). There is no cross-schema FK resolution to worry about.

### 3.3 BLOB / binary values reach every surface AS BYTES

**The spelling changed on 2026-08-24.** A `BLOB`/`BINARY` value used to reach the grid as the text
`0x0102ab`; it now reads `\x0102ab`, on every surface — the cell, the row detail sheet and the CSV —
and that is the whole point of the change: one value must not be spelled two ways depending on which
engine it came from.

`sanitizeRow()` walked every result row and turned each `Buffer` into a `0x<hex>` string (an empty
one into `''`). Its reason was real when it was written — the JSON a `Buffer` serializes to,
`{"type":"Buffer","data":[…]}`, is unreadable — and it expired when `src/lib/export/binary.ts`
(#469) started reading that exact shape. From then on the string was the only thing standing between
a MySQL BLOB and the treatment a Postgres `bytea` already got: the binary cell renderer, the detail
sheet, the CSV, and the per-dialect binary literal the SQL export writes. So the driver's rows are
now handed on unchanged, `Buffer` values included, on both `query()` and `queryInTransaction()`.

Measured on MySQL 26.7.0 (2026-08-24), replaying this export's own `INSERT` for the three bytes
`0102AB` in `r5.types.b` back into a `BLOB` column and reading `HEX()`:

| | grid / CSV | exported INSERT | replayed, `HEX(b)` / `LENGTH(b)` |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | `0x0102ab` | `VALUES (1, '0x0102ab')` | `3078303130326162` / 8 — the ASCII of `0x0102ab` |
| after | `\x0102ab` | `VALUES (1, X'0102ab')` | `0102AB` / 3 |

The before row is the defect: it stored eight characters of text where three bytes belonged, and it
stored them *successfully*. An empty `BLOB` reads `\x` rather than the empty string it used to
report — an empty byte string and a zero-length `VARCHAR` are different values and were spelled the
same — and it exports as `X''`, which replays to `LENGTH(b)` 0. A `NULL` stays `NULL` and exports as
`NULL`.

One consequence worth stating: the JSON response now carries about four characters per byte instead
of two, exactly as Postgres's does, so a very large single cell is no cheaper here than it is there.

### 3.4 Which wire protocol a statement takes

mysql2 speaks two protocols and this provider uses both. Every statement it issues goes through one
module-local helper, `runStatement(queryable, sql, params?)`
([mysql.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)), which picks by a single fact:

| Statement | Method | Protocol |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| carries parameters | `conn.execute(sql, params)` | binary, server-side prepared |
| carries none (or an empty array) | `conn.query(sql)` | text |

Parameterised statements are unchanged: the placeholders are what the prepared protocol is for, and
binding is what keeps a value out of the SQL text. So `getSchema()` and every `information_schema`
read that names the database stay prepared, while `SHOW STATUS`, `SHOW VARIABLES`, `SELECT VERSION()`,
`SHOW BINARY LOGS`, the maintenance statement, `KILL`, and a parameterless statement from the editor —
`EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON …` among them — go over the text protocol.

**Why.** Everything used to call `execute`, parameterless statements included, and three engines
refuse whole statement classes on the prepared protocol with `This command is not supported in the
prepared statement protocol yet`. Measured 2026-08-20 against a live SingleStore 9.1.1
(`ghcr.io/singlestore-labs/singlestoredb-dev:0.2.82`), both ways over one connection:

| Statement | `conn.execute` | `conn.query` |
|---|---|---|
| `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Uptime'` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections'` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `EXPLAIN <select>` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `EXPLAIN JSON <select>` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON <select>` | `ER_PARSE_ERROR` | `ER_PARSE_ERROR` |
| `OPTIMIZE TABLE customers` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `CHECK TABLE customers` | `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` | succeeds |
| `ANALYZE TABLE customers` | succeeds | succeeds |
| `SELECT VERSION()` | succeeds | succeeds |

That cost SingleStore its Test Connection, health, overview, monitoring dashboard and two of its three
maintenance actions; the registered StarRocks 3.3 row in [README.md](./README.md) records the same
failure for its overview. It is not only those two: **MySQL 26.7.0 itself refuses `CHECK TABLE` on the
prepared protocol** — measured 2026-08-24 on `mysql:latest`, `ER_UNSUPPORTED_PS` on `execute` and OK on
`query`, while the other statements above worked either way. So one of this provider's own three
maintenance actions was unavailable on the engine it is named for.

**Historical protocol probe, before the fork's EXPLAIN fallback:** on 2026-08-24,
`EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` failed on SingleStore on both protocols; plain `EXPLAIN` succeeded.
Its JSON grammar was `EXPLAIN JSON <select>`, not the form built by
[`mysql-json.ts`](../../src/lib/explain/mysql-json.ts). The protocol change alone therefore
did not recover that panel. The current fork instead probes JSON then plain EXPLAIN
and can select `mysql-text`; see [Connected EXPLAIN selection](#connected-explain-selection).
That implementation change is not a new live measurement of every compatible engine.

**The read path is safe to move because the two protocols decode to the same JS shapes.** mysql2
decodes text and binary rows on different code paths, so this was measured rather than assumed:
2026-08-24 on MySQL 26.7.0, the same `SELECT *` over one connection both ways, across a probe table
covering `TINYINT(1)`, `INT`, `BIGINT` past 2^53, `BIGINT UNSIGNED`, `DECIMAL(20,4)`, `FLOAT`,
`DOUBLE`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `TIME`, `YEAR`, `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `BLOB`,
`BIT(1)`, `BIT(8)`, `JSON`, `ENUM`, `SET` and NULLs:

- every value identical by `typeof` and by `JSON.stringify` — including the `Buffer` for `BLOB` and
  both `BIT` widths ([§3.3](#33-blob--binary-values-reach-every-surface-as-bytes)), the `Date` for the
  three temporal types, the string for `DECIMAL` and `TIME`, the parsed object for `JSON`, and the
  same `9007199254740992` for a `BIGINT` written as `9007199254740993`;
- every `FieldPacket` identical in `columnType`, `flags`, `characterSet`, `columnLength` and
  `decimals`, so `columnTypes` ([§5.4](#54-declared-column-types)) names the same types either way;
- a statement with no result set answers the same `ResultSetHeader` object, which is what the envelope
  below reads.

**Historical measurements after the protocol change, before the fork's EXPLAIN fallback.** 2026-08-24, `MySQLProvider` driven directly
against three live servers:

| Surface | MySQL 26.7.0 | SingleStore 9.1.1 | StarRocks 3.3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getHealth` (Test Connection, header badge) | ok | **recovered** | still fails — `Unknown table 'information_schema.PROCESSLIST'`, the engine's own gap, not the protocol |
| `getOverview` | ok | **recovered** (reads MySQL 5.7.32, the wire version) | **recovered** (reads MySQL 5.1.0, the fictitious `version()`) |
| `getPerformanceMetrics` | ok | answers `{}` — nothing measured rather than a fabricated number | answers `{}` |
| `getStorageStats` | ok | **recovered** | **recovered** |
| `getSchema`, table/index stats, editor query, transactions | ok | ok | ok |
| maintenance `analyze` / `optimize` / `check` | all three ok (`check` **recovered**) | all three ok (`optimize`, `check` **recovered**) | n/a |
| Explain (`EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON`) | ok | still fails — `ER_PARSE_ERROR`, see above | not re-probed |

One behaviour does differ, and only for a connection that opted into `multipleStatements=true` in its
connection string: a `;`-separated statement is rejected by the prepared protocol and accepted by the
text one, which then answers an array of result sets. That is the shape `CALL <procedure>()` already
answers today on both protocols, so nothing new reaches the envelope; the app splits multi-statement
input itself (`POST /api/db/multi-query`) and issues one statement per call.

`rowCount` is `rows.length` **only when the driver returns a row array** (i.e. `SELECT`); for a
non-`SELECT` statement mysql2 returns a `ResultSetHeader` rather than an array, and the provider
reports its `affectedRows` — see [§5.1](#51-execution) for the full envelope.

This section used to say affected-rows was not surfaced and `rowCount` was reported as 0. That
described the intent of one line; the line beside it called `.map` on the same header and threw, so
what the user actually got for every DDL and DML statement was an error for work the server had
already done.

### 3.5 No server-side query timeout

The pool config ([mysql.ts:114](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)) intentionally sets only
mysql2-specific options and **does not** translate `ProviderOptions.queryTimeout` into a server-side
timeout (MySQL has no direct `statement_timeout` pool option like Postgres). A runaway query is not
auto-killed by the provider; cancellation is explicit via [`cancelQuery()`](#53-query-cancellation).

### 3.6 Maintenance over all tables when no target

`analyze`/`optimize`/`check` without a target run against **all base tables** in the database
(`getAllTablesForMaintenance()`, capped at **50** tables, [mysql.ts:577](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)),
each name quoted via `escapeIdentifier()`. With a target, the single quoted table is used.

---

## 4. Connection

### 4.1 Configuration

Two forms (`validate()`, [mysql.ts:66](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)). `validate()`
requires `host` **and** `database` only when no `connectionString` is given — it does not reject
supplying both; if both are present the connection string is used (passed to the pool as `uri`).

```ts
// Discrete fields (host + database required when no connection string)
const a = { id: 'my-1', name: 'App DB', type: 'mysql',
  host: 'localhost', port: 3306, database: 'app',
  user: 'root', password: 'secret', createdAt: new Date() };

// Connection string
const b = { id: 'my-1', name: 'App DB', type: 'mysql',
  connectionString: 'mysql://root:secret@localhost:3306/app', createdAt: new Date() };
```

### 4.2 Connection pooling

`connect()` builds a `mysql2` pool and validates it by acquiring/releasing one connection. The pool
options ([mysql.ts:114](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)):

| mysql2 option | Value | Source |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| `connectionLimit` | pool `max` (default 10) | `ProviderOptions.pool.max` |
| `waitForConnections` | `true` | fixed |
| `queueLimit` | `0` (unbounded queue) | fixed |
| `enableKeepAlive` | `true` | fixed |
| `keepAliveInitialDelay` | `10000` ms | fixed |
| `timezone` | `'Z'` | `ProviderOptions.timezone ?? 'Z'` (discrete form only — see below) |

> ⚠️ Only `max` from `DEFAULT_POOL_CONFIG` is honored. `min`, `idleTimeout`, and `acquireTimeout`
> are **not** mapped (the mysql2 pool model differs from `pg`), and `queryTimeout` is **not** applied
> (see [§3.5](#35-no-server-side-query-timeout)).
>
> ⚠️ When a **`connectionString`** is supplied, `buildPoolConfig()` returns `{ ...baseConfig, uri }`
> and takes the discrete-fields branch **not at all** — so `timezone`, `ssl`/`connection.ssl`, and
> cloud SSL auto-detect are **ignored**; those settings must be encoded in the URI itself.

`connect()` is idempotent. Unlike the PostgreSQL provider, MySQL exposes **no** `getPoolStats()`.

### 4.3 SSL

`buildSSLConfig()` ([mysql.ts:142](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)) — applied **only in the
discrete-fields form** (the `connectionString` path bypasses it entirely). Note `disable` returns
`undefined` (mysql2's "off"), not `false`:

1. **Explicit `connection.ssl`** (`SSLConfig`): `disable` → `undefined`; `require` →
   `rejectUnauthorized: false` (the one mode that encrypts without verifying);
   `verify-system`/`verify-ca`/`verify-full` → `rejectUnauthorized: true`;
   `caCert`/`clientCert`/`clientKey` → `ca`/`cert`/`key`. `verify-system` passes **no** `ca`, so
   mysql2 hands `tls.connect` Node's own trust store — that mode exists precisely so a managed
   endpoint can be verified with no PEM to paste. mysql2 exposes no separate host-name check, so
   `verify-ca` and `verify-full` build the same object.
2. **`options.ssl === true` or cloud auto-detect** — `shouldEnableSSL()` (`options.ssl === true` *or*
   a known managed host) enables `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }`.
3. Otherwise `undefined`.

#### `ssl-mode` in a pasted URL

The paste box ([`connection-string-parser.ts`](../../src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts)) reads the
query string, so `mysql://host/db?ssl-mode=REQUIRED` arrives with SSL Mode already set. The values are
matched case-insensitively (MySQL writes them upper-case) and `sslmode` is accepted as an alias:
`DISABLED` → `disable`, `REQUIRED` → `require`, `VERIFY_CA` → `verify-ca`, `VERIFY_IDENTITY` →
`verify-full` (it checks the hostname as well as the chain).

The boolean spellings are read too, and mapped at both ends because a boolean has no opportunistic
value: `?ssl=true`, `?ssl=1`, `?useSSL=true` → **`verify-system`**; `?ssl=false`, `?ssl=0`,
`?useSSL=false` → `disable`. An explicit `ssl-mode` wins when a string carries both.

The rule (D26, stated in `readBooleanTLS`) is that a boolean maps onto the mode matching what the
engine's own driver does with it, never onto a weaker one — and the driver this provider uses is
mysql2, which defaults `rejectUnauthorized` to `true` for any `ssl` object it is handed
(`node_modules/mysql2/lib/connection_config.js:171`). `verify-system` is that behaviour exactly:
verified, with no CA certificate to find. The mapping was `require` until `verify-system` existed —
`rejectUnauthorized: false` ([mysql.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)), encrypted with the
chain unchecked — because the only verifying modes on the form were the two that demand a PEM.

One spelling is now mapped **stronger** than its writer meant: Connector/J's `useSSL=true` leaves
`verifyServerCertificate` off unless `sslMode` is `VERIFY_CA`/`VERIFY_IDENTITY`. That direction is the
deliberate one — a connection refused for an unverifiable certificate says so on screen, while a
silent downgrade to unverified TLS says nothing at all, and the SSL / TLS panel is one click away for
a server presenting a self-signed certificate. mysql2's
object form (`?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}`) is not a boolean and is reported in the banner rather
than guessed at.

`PREFERRED` is **not** mapped, and neither is any spelling the map does not know. It means "encrypt if
the server offers it", and mapping it onto `disable` would downgrade a connection that was in fact
encrypted: measured over TCP against MySQL with its default self-signed certificate,
`--ssl-mode=PREFERRED` negotiated `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` while `--ssl-mode=DISABLED` left
`Ssl_cipher` empty. Mapping it onto `require` is the mirror-image guess. So the mode the form already
holds is left alone and the paste banner names the parameter it declined to act on; choose SSL Mode
yourself in the SSL / TLS panel.

---

## 5. Query interface

### 5.1 Execution

`query(sql, params?, queryId?)` ([mysql.ts:185](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)) acquires a
pooled connection, optionally records its `threadId` for cancellation, runs the statement over the
protocol its parameters imply ([§3.4](#34-which-wire-protocol-a-statement-takes)), and returns the
standard envelope with the driver's own values
([§3.3](#33-blob--binary-values-reach-every-surface-as-bytes)):

```ts
{ rows, fields: string[], rowCount: rows.length, executionTime, columnTypes? }
```

Native `mysql2` errors are normalised via `mapDatabaseError()` into the shared
[`errors.ts`](../../src/lib/db/errors.ts) classes.

**A statement that returns no result set** — every DDL statement, and `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` —
answers a different envelope, because `mysql2` hands back a different thing. The driver's first return
value is an array of rows only when the statement produced a result set; otherwise it is a
`ResultSetHeader` OBJECT and the field packets arrive as `undefined` — the same both ways, measured on
either protocol ([§3.4](#34-which-wire-protocol-a-statement-takes)). Printed verbatim out of mysql2
against mysql 26.7.0 for `INSERT INTO r5_hdr (note) VALUES ('a'),('b')`:

```js
{ fieldCount: 0, affectedRows: 2, insertId: 1,
  info: "Records: 2  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0",
  serverStatus: 2, warningStatus: 0, changedRows: 0 }
```

So the answer is no rows, no fields, no `columnTypes`, and the affected-row count in `rowCount`:

```ts
{ rows: [], fields: [], rowCount: header.affectedRows, executionTime }
```

That matches what the other SQL providers here already report for the same statements — SQL Server
uses `rowsAffected[0]`, SQLite `changes`, PostgreSQL `pg`'s own `rowCount` — and `rowCount` is the
number the results footer renders. `insertId`, `changedRows` and `warningStatus` are dropped:
`QueryResult` models none of them. `affectedRows` is the **matched** count, so a no-op
`UPDATE … SET note = note` reports 1 while `changedRows` is 0 — the same way SQL Server's
`rowsAffected` counts.

Until this was fixed, both this path and `queryInTransaction()` called `.map` on that header and threw
`result.rows.map is not a function` — **after** the server had already applied the statement. Measured
through `createDatabaseProvider({type:"mysql"})` on 2026-08-23: `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`,
`UPDATE` and `DELETE` each failed, and a following `SELECT` returned the row the failed `INSERT` had
written. Reporting a failure for work that landed is the answer that makes a user retry and
double-apply it.

### 5.2 Automatic `LIMIT` injection

Inherited from `SQLBaseProvider.prepareQuery()` (see [PostgreSQL doc §5.2](./postgres.md#52-automatic-limit-injection)).
The shared `analyzeQuery()` recognises both standard `LIMIT n [OFFSET m]` and MySQL's
`LIMIT offset, count` form, so an already-limited MySQL query is respected rather than double-limited.
Default page size `DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT = 500`; unlimited caps at `MAX_UNLIMITED_ROWS = 100000`.

MySQL's `#` line comment is skipped when the statement type is read, alongside `--` and `/* … */`
([`leading-keyword.ts`](../../src/lib/sql/leading-keyword.ts)). This is the dialect that marker exists
for: a `# note`-led `SELECT` used to classify as an unknown statement type and reach the server with
no `LIMIT` at all (#275).

Every `#` is a comment marker here, and this provider now says so: `prepareQuery()` passes its own
`type` to the shared readers, which resolve `#` under MySQL's grammar instead of the dialect-less
compromise they used to apply to everyone (see
[Which dialect the readers are reading](../editor/query-optimization.md#which-dialect-the-readers-are-reading)).
Three readings change on this provider, and each was wrong in a way only MySQL sees:

| Statement | Before | Now |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| `SELECT … # note` | not bounded at all — the bound has to go before the comment, and the reader could not rule out `#tmp`/`ID#`/XOR | bounded, with the clause before the comment |
| `SELECT * FROM t # LIMIT 10` | the commented-out bound read as a real one, so the statement ran unbounded | the comment is a comment; a real bound is added before it |
| `WITH t AS (` + `#- drop the ) SELECT here` + `…) DELETE FROM users` | the `#-` read as a PostgreSQL jsonb operator, so the `)` inside the comment closed the CTE body, the statement typed `SELECT` and a `LIMIT` was appended to a `DELETE` — which MySQL 8 accepts and commits | typed `DELETE`, not bounded |

The third row is the one that cost more than rows: a bound on a `DELETE` commits part of it while the
UI reports a truncated result set. A trailing `-- note` was always bounded normally and is unchanged.

### 5.3 Query cancellation

A query issued with a `queryId` records its connection `threadId`. `cancelQuery(queryId)`
([mysql.ts:215](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)) issues `KILL QUERY <threadId>` and returns
`true` on success (it does not verify the target was actually mid-query). The killed query surfaces
to its caller as a `QueryCancelledError` (MySQL emits *"Query execution was interrupted"*, which
`mapDatabaseError()` classifies as cancellation). Exposed via `POST /api/db/cancel`.

### 5.4 Declared column types

`mysql2` reports a column's type as a protocol type CODE plus flags, a charset number and a length -
never a name. The codes are not one type each, so `QueryResult.columnTypes`
([column-types.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/column-types.ts)) resolves them from all four
pieces. Measured on MySQL 26.7.0 over a 40-column probe table, printed straight out of the driver:

| declared | code | length | charset | flags | reported as |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BIGINT` | 8 | 20 | 63 | 0 | `bigint` |
| `DECIMAL(10,2)` | 246 | 12 | 63 | 0 | `decimal` |
| `TINYINT` / `TINYINT(1)` / `BOOLEAN` | 1 | 4 / 1 / 1 | 63 | 0 | `tinyint` |
| `VARCHAR(40)` | 253 | 160 | 224 | 0 | `varchar` |
| `VARBINARY(9)` | 253 | 9 | 63 | 128 | `varbinary` |
| `CHAR(10)` / `BINARY(8)` | 254 | 40 / 8 | 224 / 63 | 0 / 128 | `char` / `binary` |
| `ENUM('a','b')` / `SET('x','y')` | 254 | 4 / 12 | 224 | 256 / 2048 | `enum` / `set` |
| `TEXT` / `BLOB` | 252 | 262140 / 65535 | 224 / 63 | 16 / 144 | `text` / `blob` |
| `TINYTEXT` … `LONGTEXT` | 252 | 1020 / 262140 / 67108860 / 4294967295 | 224 | 16 | `tinytext` … `longtext` |
| `JSON` | 245 | 4294967295 | 63 | 144 | `json` |
| `GEOMETRY` / `POINT` | 255 | 4294967295 | 63 | 144 | `geometry` (both) |

Two things that table settles, neither of which is guessable from the code alone:

- **Charset 63 (`binary`) separates a character type from a byte type.** The BLOB flag is set for
  `TEXT` as well as for `BLOB` and cannot do it.
- **All four text tiers and all four blob tiers arrive as one code, 252.** Only the length tells them
  apart, so the tier is read from its ceiling (a tier's byte capacity times the charset's maximum
  bytes per character - 4 for utf8mb4 - and the tiers are 256x apart, so the ranges never overlap).

What the names deliberately leave out: the length, precision or display width (`decimal`, not
`decimal(10,2)`), the `unsigned` suffix, and the `point` subtype the protocol does not carry.
Checked column by column against `information_schema.COLUMNS.DATA_TYPE` for the same 40-column
table - the same source the schema tree shows - **38 of 39 match exactly**; the one difference is
`POINT`, which arrives as code 255 with nothing to distinguish it from `GEOMETRY`.

`columnTypes` is filled by `query()` and `queryInTransaction()`, and is **absent entirely** when no
column declared a type. Its consumers are the results grid's column labels, the SQL-DDL export
(which prefers a declared type over its own value-shaped guess) and the agent's state summary. This
matters most for the types whose values arrive as strings: a `DECIMAL` reaches the browser as
`"19.99"`, so before this the DDL export wrote it as `TEXT`.

## 6. Transactions

Identical lifecycle to PostgreSQL, on a **dedicated connection checked out from the pool and held
for the transaction's duration** (so every statement runs on the same connection; it is not returned
to the pool until commit/rollback). Surfaced via `POST /api/db/transaction`.

| Method | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| `beginTransaction()` | `pool.getConnection()` + `beginTransaction()`, arms a **5-minute auto-rollback** timer ([mysql.ts:41](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)). Throws if one is active. |
| `queryInTransaction(sql, params?)` | Runs on the transaction's connection (with the same non-SELECT envelope as §5.1). Throws if none active. |
| `commitTransaction()` / `rollbackTransaction()` | Ends it, clears the timer, releases the connection. Throws if none active. |
| `expireTransaction()` | Timeout callback — auto-`rollback()` to prevent leaked locks. |
| `isInTransaction()` | Current state. |

---

## 7. Schema introspection

`getSchema()` returns one `TableSchema` per `BASE TABLE` in the connected database. Per table it
issues three follow-up queries:

| Data | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tables | `information_schema.TABLES` | `TABLE_ROWS` (engine estimate), `DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH` |
| Columns | `information_schema.COLUMNS` | first 100 (`LIMIT 100`); `isPrimary` = `COLUMN_KEY = 'PRI'` |
| Foreign keys | `information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE` | rows where `REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL` |
| Indexes | `information_schema.STATISTICS` | `GROUP_CONCAT` columns by `SEQ_IN_INDEX`; `unique` = `NOT NON_UNIQUE` |

There is no `getSchemaList()`/`getSchemaRelations()` — see [§3.1](#31-n1-schema-introspection-no-materialized-ctes-no-two-phase-split).

---

## 8. Monitoring & health

All monitoring reads from `SHOW STATUS`/`SHOW VARIABLES`, `information_schema`, and
`performance_schema`. `getMonitoringData()` (inherited) fans these out in parallel.

| Method | Primary source | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| `getHealth()` | `SHOW STATUS`, `information_schema.TABLES`/`PROCESSLIST`, `performance_schema` | connections, size (MB), InnoDB buffer hit %, top-5 slow queries, 10 sessions |
| `getOverview()` | `VERSION()`, `SHOW STATUS/VARIABLES`, `information_schema` | version, uptime, conns, max_conns, size, table/index counts |
| `getPerformanceMetrics()` | `performance_schema.global_status`, `SHOW STATUS` | cache-hit %, **queries/sec** (`Queries`/`Uptime`), buffer-pool %, deadlocks. Every field optional — see the degradation note below |
| `getSlowQueries()` | `performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` | per-digest stats |
| `getActiveSessions()` | `information_schema.PROCESSLIST` | pid, user, db, host, command, duration |
| `getTableStats()` | `information_schema.TABLES` | sizes; bloat **estimated from `DATA_FREE`** (no live/dead tuples, no last-vacuum/analyze) |
| `getIndexStats()` | `information_schema.STATISTICS` + `mysql.innodb_index_stats` | columns, unique/primary; **`scans` = `CARDINALITY`** (a proxy, not a real scan counter); per-index size, or **absent** — see the index-size note below |
| `getStorageStats()` | `information_schema.TABLES`, `SHOW BINARY LOGS` | Data size, Binary Logs (if enabled), InnoDB data file (size `N/A`) |

**Graceful degradation — note the *different* failure modes:**
- `getHealth()` slow-queries: the digest rows, or **an empty list** — never a placeholder row, and
  on this path **the reason is dropped**. It used to answer a single fabricated row
  (*"Performance schema not available"*, `calls: 0`) whenever its statement threw, and its statement
  threw on every server: see
  [the slow-query line asked for a column the digest table does not have](#the-slow-query-line-asked-for-a-column-the-digest-table-does-not-have)
  below. `HealthInfo.slowQueries` is a `SlowQuery[]` with no error field and no sibling carrying one,
  so an unreadable source is indistinguishable here from a source that measured nothing. Empty is
  the least-wrong shape, not a shape that carries the reason — the operator gets the reason from the
  `getSlowQueries()` path below, which does have a channel for it.
- `getHealth()` cache-hit ratio: `formatCacheHitRatio()` → `"N/A"` when nothing was measured, and
  `"N/A"` again — rather than a failed health read — when the ratio query THROWS. A tenant can be
  missing the `performance_schema` *database* instead of merely having the schema off, and then the
  query does not answer NULLs: measured 2026-08-20 on a live OceanBase Community Edition 4.4.2.1
  tenant through this provider, and reproduced on `mysql:latest` as `ERROR 1049 (42000): Unknown
  database '...'`. That one throw used to abort the whole of `getHealth()`, so the panel showed
  nothing where one unavailable metric was the honest answer.
- `getSlowQueries()`: **the digests, or the server's refusal — this one does not swallow.** It used
  to `return []` on any throw, which made a source that cannot be read look like a source that
  measured nothing. What throws here is never the `performance_schema`-is-off path — an off server
  answers 0 rows without raising — it is the source being *unreadable*: no `performance_schema`
  database (`ERROR 1049`), or the grant denied on it (`ERROR 1142`). Letting that reject is what
  puts the reason on screen: `getMonitoringData()`
  ([`base-provider.ts`](../../src/lib/db/base-provider.ts)) reads every panel with
  `Promise.allSettled` and records a rejected one under `errors.slowQueries`, and `QueriesTab`
  renders that through `PanelUnavailable` carrying the server's own sentence. One refused panel
  costs only itself; that method throws only when all four core reads reject.
- `getPerformanceMetrics()`: **every field is omitted rather than defaulted.** A server with
  `performance_schema` OFF answers the `global_status` sub-selects with NULL instead of failing, so
  each reading is taken through `measuredNumber()` and a field with nothing behind it is left out of
  the object entirely. `deadlocks` comes from `SHOW STATUS`, which answers either way, so a `0` there
  is a real measurement and is reported *where the server publishes one*. If the
  `performance_schema` database is absent outright — the OceanBase case above, where every one of
  these queries raises `ERROR 1049` — the whole method returns `{}` rather than the `cacheHitRatio:
  99` it once did. This is the rule #448 and #452 settled: ABSENCE and
  ZERO are different inputs, and only the first is invisible to the panels.
- `deadlocks` reads `Innodb_deadlocks`, which is **MariaDB's** status variable. MySQL does not publish
  it — measured as an empty `SHOW STATUS` result on both 8.0.46 and 26.7.0 — so the field is absent on
  MySQL and present on MariaDB. It is the one metric that survives `performance_schema` being off.

### The slow-query line asked for a column the digest table does not have

`getHealth()`'s slow-query line had its own statement, `LEFT(sql_text, 100)` over
`performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest`, wrapped in a bare try/catch that reported
`[{ query: "Performance schema not available", calls: 0, avgTime: "N/A" }]`. **That table has no
`sql_text` column.** `SQL_TEXT` belongs to `events_statements_current`/`_history`; the digest table
carries the normalised `DIGEST_TEXT` — [MySQL 9.4 manual, Statement Summary
Tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.4/en/performance-schema-statement-summary-tables.html),
and each server's own `information_schema.columns` confirms it. So the statement never returned a
row on any server, and the catch reported an engine capability as absent while the panel beside it
listed real statements from the same table.

Measured 2026-08-27 through this provider, one container per arm (`--innodb-use-native-aio=0`;
readiness gated on a real `SELECT 1`, not `mysqladmin ping`). The raw statement's answer on all four:

```
errno=1054 code=ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR sqlState=42S22 Unknown column 'sql_text' in 'field list'
```

(MariaDB words the same error `Unknown column 'sql_text' in 'SELECT'`.)

| Server | `@@performance_schema` | `getHealth().slowQueries` before | after | `getSlowQueries()` |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------|--------------------|
| MySQL 26.7.0 (`mysql:latest`) | 1 | *"Performance schema not available"* | 5 real digests — ``SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM `t` `` at `calls: 4`, `1.09ms` | 5 rows |
| Percona Server 8.4.11-11 | 1 | *"Performance schema not available"* | 5 real digests | 5 rows |
| MySQL 26.7.0, `--performance-schema=OFF` | 0 | *"Performance schema not available"* | `[]` | `[]` |
| MariaDB 12.3.2 (ships it off) | 0 | *"Performance schema not available"* | `[]` | `[]` |

Three decisions came out of those measurements, and one property of the reading that none of them
changes.

**One statement, not two.** The health line and `getSlowQueries()` now share
`SLOW_QUERIES_BODY_SQL`, differing only in the interpolated `LIMIT` (5 for the health line, the
caller's for the panel), and both map the row through the same `toSlowQueryStats()`. Two statements
for one fact is what drifted, and the copy the health panel used was the one no test ever put in
front of a server — the mysql2 mock invented a `query` column for any statement over this table, so
a broken read looked like a working one for as long as it was only mocked. The mysql2 mock in
`mysql-provider.test.ts` now refuses `sql_text` the way a server does, one test asserts the provider
never asks for it, and a construction in the mock's single call funnel records any fixture that
answers such a statement instead of refusing it ([§12.1](#121-how-the-tests-work)).

**An empty list, not an "unavailable" marker, and the reason is that OFF does not raise.** A server
with `@@performance_schema` = 0 keeps the digest table selectable and answers **0 rows** — measured
on both arms above, and it is why MariaDB's default has always shown an empty Queries panel rather
than an error. There is therefore no exception that means "the capability is off", and a marker
keyed on the throw would be emitted for something other than what it says: the same defect one level
up. What does reach the catch is the source being *unreadable* — no `performance_schema` database at
all (`ERROR 1049`, the OceanBase tenant above) or the grant denied on it: measured on MySQL 26.7.0
with a user granted only `SELECT ON d32.*` plus `PROCESS`,

```
errno=1142 code=ER_TABLEACCESS_DENIED_ERROR sqlState=42000
SELECT command denied to user 'nops'@'172.17.0.1' for table 'events_statements_summary_by_digest'
```

and on that connection `getHealth()` still answered in full (`activeConnections: 1`, `databaseSize:
"0.02 MB"`, `cacheHitRatio: "94.3"`, one active session) with `slowQueries: []`.

**Why the refusal is not carried in this field: on the health path it is dropped.** A refusal must stay
representable as a refusal (#477), and a row is the one shape it must not take: `calls: 0` is a
figure nobody took, and the list was *counted* — the agent's curated health reading then forwarded
`health.slowQueries.length` as `slowQueryCount`
([`src/lib/agent/tools.ts`](../../src/lib/agent/tools.ts)), so the invented row told the model
"1 slow query" about every MySQL-family server. That projection no longer carries any length, so a
row invented here would now be silent rather than counted — which is a reason to keep it out, not a
reason it could come back.

Dropped is the honest word for it, and this paragraph says so rather than naming a carrier the
reading does not have. `HealthInfo.slowQueries` is a `SlowQuery[]`: no error field, no sibling that carries one, so a
refusal cannot be represented in this reading at all. Nothing renders it either — no component reads
`HealthInfo.slowQueries` (the monitoring Queries and Overview tabs read `MonitoringData.slowQueries`,
a different reading), and the one caller of `POST /api/db/health`, the 60s connection pulse in
[`use-connection-manager.ts`](../../src/hooks/use-connection-manager.ts), reads `res.ok` and
discards the body. `ProviderLabels.slowQueriesEmptyState` is **not** a carrier for it: `QueriesTab`
renders that one fixed sentence for every empty list whatever produced it, which is why the sentence
had to stop naming a cause (it used to end *"enable the Performance Schema to see them"* — the one
cause that never reaches the failure path).

The operator is not left without the reason, because the *panel* path has a channel:
`getSlowQueries()` lets the refusal reject (it used to `return []`), `getMonitoringData()`
([`base-provider.ts`](../../src/lib/db/base-provider.ts)) records it under `errors.slowQueries`, and
`QueriesTab` renders it through `PanelUnavailable` with the server's own sentence. The
grant-denied and `ERROR 1049` fixtures in `mysql-provider.test.ts` assert exactly that division: the
health line empties, `getSlowQueries()` rejects, and `errors.slowQueries` names the table.

**One property of the reading the repair does not change: the list is a cap, not a count.**
`SLOW_QUERIES_BODY_SQL` has no slowness predicate anywhere — its only `WHERE` term is the connected
schema, "slow" is the *ordering* (`SUM_TIMER_WAIT DESC`), and the health line's `LIMIT` is 5. So on
any server with five or more digests for the schema, `health.slowQueries.length` is 5 permanently,
and any consumer counting it reads the limit rather than a number of slow statements. Measured 2026-08-27
on MySQL 26.7.0 (`libredb-mysql`): the digest table held **59 rows** for one connected schema, and
the five this statement returns for it were **all Studio's own introspection statements** — the
slow-query read itself first (`avg 79.11ms`, `calls 3`), then the database-size read, `SHOW STATUS
LIKE ?` and two `PREPARE`s, between 1.15 ms and 7.78 ms. Nothing in that list is slow and none of it
is the user's workload. Raising the limit would move the saturation point without making the figure a
count; only a slowness threshold, or a differently named projection, would. The agent's curated
health reading has since stopped projecting the length at all — it declares
`activeConnections`, `databaseSize` and `cacheHitRatio` only, and the slow-query facts travel on the
`slow-queries` reading, where the rows are visible
([`src/lib/agent/tools.ts`](../../src/lib/agent/tools.ts)) — so this provider's part is that the cap
and the missing threshold are stated at
[`HEALTH_SLOW_QUERY_LIMIT`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts) and pinned by a test that reads
the statement the health call actually issued.

**Sibling engines.** All nine MySQL-protocol engines in
[`compatibility.ts`](../../src/lib/db/compatibility.ts) — MariaDB, Percona Server for MySQL, TiDB,
StarRocks, Apache Doris, Databend, Vitess, OceanBase, SingleStore — reach this exact code, so every
one of them showed the sentence and none of them shows it now. MariaDB and Percona are the two
measured above; on the other seven the health line now carries whatever their own
`performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` publishes for the connected schema, and an
empty list where it publishes nothing or the table cannot be read. OceanBase is the one whose reading
changes shape without changing meaning: its tenants have no `performance_schema` database at all
(`ERROR 1049`, measured 2026-08-20), so its health line goes from the fabricated row to `[]` — and
its Queries panel, which took the same `[]` before, now shows the tenant's own `ERROR 1049` through
`PanelUnavailable`, because `getSlowQueries()` no longer swallows it.

**Index sizes: `mysql.innodb_index_stats`, and `indexSizeBytes` may be absent.** The per-index byte
figure is `stat_value * @@innodb_page_size` for the `stat_name = 'size'` row of the InnoDB
persistent-statistics table, matched to the `information_schema.STATISTICS` row on
database/table/index name. Three consequences, all measured on 2026-08-23:

- **No `INNODB_*` view publishes it.** The former statement summed
  `information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES.INDEX_SIZE`, a column that exists on neither MySQL 26.7.0
  nor the MySQL 8.0 inside Vitess 24.0.2 (`ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR` on both), so *every* index reported
  `0 B` on every server. It also grouped by `(t.NAME, i.NAME)` while selecting a tablespace total,
  which made the figure per-table even when the query worked.
- **The schema is the one the server reports, not the one you connected to.** Vitess answers
  `information_schema.STATISTICS` with the physical shard database — `vt_probe_0`, not the keyspace
  `probe` — so the size lookup uses the `TABLE_SCHEMA` value just returned. With that, a per-index
  size on Vitess reads the same 16 KB as the MySQL control; the old `LIKE 'probe/%'` matched nothing.
- **A missing row means unavailable, not empty.** Reading `mysql.innodb_index_stats` needs `SELECT`
  on the `mysql` schema (`ER_TABLEACCESS_DENIED_ERROR` for a user granted only its own database), and
  MyISAM tables have no row there at all. In both cases `indexSizeBytes` is **omitted** and
  `indexSize` is `"N/A"`, rather than a `0 B` the server never reported.

**The storage panel's index total is the per-TABLE figure, not the sum of those per-index rows.**
InnoDB has no separate primary-key index: the clustered index IS the table, so
`mysql.innodb_index_stats` reports the `PRIMARY` row's size as the row data and summing every index
row counts that data twice. Measured on MySQL 26.7.0 against a 144 KB database, the sum read
147,456 B — 49,152 of data plus 98,304 of indexes — which drew *Indexes* as 100% of the database and
a remainder of `-49152 B`. `getTableStats()` carries `INDEX_LENGTH` as `indexSizeBytes` (it computed
that number and dropped it before 2026-08-23, which is why the panel had nothing to add up), and
that is what MySQL itself calls index bytes.

---

## 9. Maintenance

`runMaintenance(type, target?)` ([mysql.ts:525](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)); targets
are backtick-quoted via `escapeIdentifier()`:

| Type | With target | Without target |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `analyze` | `ANALYZE TABLE <t>` | `ANALYZE TABLE <all base tables, ≤50>` |
| `optimize` | `OPTIMIZE TABLE <t>` | `OPTIMIZE TABLE <all base tables, ≤50>` |
| `check` | `CHECK TABLE <t>` | `CHECK TABLE <all base tables, ≤50>` |
| `kill` | `KILL <connection-id>` | throws (id required) |

`getCapabilities().maintenanceOperations = ['analyze', 'optimize', 'check', 'kill']`. `kill`
validates that the target parses as an integer connection id.

### The verdict is in the result set, not in the absence of an exception

`ANALYZE`, `OPTIMIZE` and `CHECK TABLE` answer a **result set** — one row per (table, message)
with `Table` / `Op` / `Msg_type` / `Msg_text` — and a statement the server refuses resolves
normally. Measured through the driver against MySQL 26.7.0 (`libredb-mysql`) on 2026-08-25:

| Statement | Rows MySQL answers |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `OPTIMIZE TABLE \`real1\`` | `note` *"Table does not support optimize, doing recreate + analyze instead"*, then `status` *"OK"* |
| `OPTIMIZE TABLE \`missing\`` | `Error` *"Table 'u9t.missing' doesn't exist"*, then `status` *"Operation failed"* |
| `CHECK TABLE \`real1\`` | `status` *"OK"* |

So `await runStatement(conn, sql); return { success: true }` reported a completed operation for
a statement the server had rejected — `optimize u9t` answered
`{"success":true,"message":"OPTIMIZE completed successfully"}` while the server's own answer was
Error / *"Table 'u9t.missing' doesn't exist"* / *"Operation failed"* — and it discarded the
`Msg_text` that is the entire point of `CHECK TABLE`, whose OK-or-corruption-report is the only
thing the user asked for. `readMaintenanceReport()` reads those rows:

- **any row with `Msg_type` = `error`** (matched case-insensitively; the server sends `Error`,
  the manual documents the set in lower case) → `success: false`, and the message quotes those
  rows **with their table names**, because the whole-database form names every table in one
  statement and a per-table Error row is the only place the failure appears;
- **otherwise** → `success: true`, and the message quotes the engine's own texts, deduplicated:
  over forty tables the OK and InnoDB's *"doing recreate + analyze instead"* note repeat once
  per table and say the same thing forty times.

After the fix, through the provider: `check real1` → *"CHECK: OK"*, `optimize missing` →
`success: false` *"OPTIMIZE failed: u9t.missing: Table 'u9t.missing' doesn't exist"*. This is the
same read SQLite's `check` already did with `PRAGMA integrity_check`.

**A database with no tables runs no statement.** `OPTIMIZE TABLE ${getAllTablesForMaintenance()}`
string-joined an empty list, and MySQL answered *"You have an error in your SQL syntax … near
''"* — measured through the provider against an empty database on 2026-08-25. Nothing to do is
not a failure and it is not a syntax error either, so the whole-database form now answers
`success: true` with *"OPTIMIZE: no tables in u9empty to run it on."* without sending anything.

### Where each operation may be offered (`maintenanceOperationSpecs`)

Declaring that an operation EXISTS is not enough to put a button on it: two engines that
declare the same `MaintenanceType` take different kinds of target, so each provider also
declares what its own operations may be pointed at. The monitoring Tables tab renders a
per-row control only where `perEntity` is true, the admin Operations tab a whole-database
card only where `global` is true, and both take the wording from `label` (#496).

`POST /api/db/maintenance` reads the same declaration since #U20, and it is the one reader that
REFUSES rather than hides: it takes the placement from whether the request carries a `target`
(absent or empty means whole-database) and answers `400` when this provider marks that
placement unavailable while the other one is available. On MySQL it never speaks: every
declaration above is either both placements or neither, so no request can name a placement this
provider offers in one place only.

| Operation | Control label | Per-row | Global | Why |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|-----|
| `analyze` | Analyze Table | yes | yes | `ANALYZE TABLE <t>`, or every table via `getAllTablesForMaintenance()` |
| `optimize` | Optimize Table | yes | yes | `OPTIMIZE TABLE <t>`, same loop without a target |
| `check` | Check Table | yes | yes | `CHECK TABLE <t>`, same loop without a target |
| `kill` | Kill Connection | no | no | the target is a connection id from the Sessions panel |

MySQL has no `VACUUM`, and the base labels put *"Vacuum Table"* in the explorer's row menu
and *"Run Vacuum" / "Reclaim Space"* on the Operations tab anyway. The labels now say
*"Optimize Table"* / *"Run Optimize" / "Optimize Tables"*, and `vacuumActionOperation:
'optimize'` is what makes the surfaces send `optimize` for them - the global card used to be
gated on the literal `vacuum`, so MySQL's own wording was written and never shown (#496).

## 10. Capabilities & labels

### `getCapabilities()` ([mysql.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts))

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `queryLanguage` | `sql` |
| `supportsExplain` | Initially `true`; after connect, true only if an estimate probe succeeds |
| `explainFormat` | Initially `mysql-json`; connected value can be `mysql-json`, `mysql-text`, or absent |
| `supportsExplainAnalyze` | `false` — analyze is not enabled by this provider |
| `supportsExternalQueryLimiting` | `true` (from base) |
| `supportsCreateTable` | `true` (from base) |
| `supportsInlineRowEdit` | `true` — `UPDATE t SET c = v WHERE pk = v` is core MySQL DML |
| `supportsTransactions` | `true` — the transaction runs on one held connection through the driver's own `beginTransaction()`, so the trio and the SANDBOX toggle are offered (#464) |
| `declaresForeignKeys` | `true` — inherited from the base capabilities; InnoDB declares them, so an empty list means this schema (or this role) has none, not the engine |
| `supportsMaintenance` | `true` |
| `maintenanceOperations` | `['analyze', 'optimize', 'check', 'kill']` |
| `supportsConnectionString` | `true` |
| `defaultPort` | `3306` |
| `schemaRefreshPattern` | `(CREATE\|DROP\|ALTER\|TRUNCATE)\b` (from base) |

### Connected EXPLAIN selection

During `connect()`, fixed parameterless probes use the existing text-protocol path:
first `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON SELECT 1`, then `EXPLAIN SELECT 1` only if JSON fails.
The first success selects `mysql-json` or `mysql-text`; if both fail, EXPLAIN becomes
unavailable without making that grammar refusal a connection failure.

Both background and explicit editor requests use estimate for this provider.
`supportsExplainAnalyze` remains false even if a particular server implements an
executing EXPLAIN variant. The connected query route refuses analyze rather than
guessing a variant or executing the original SQL. Plain EXPLAIN plans render as a
generic tree; the existing `mysql-json` render adapter is still a legacy passthrough,
not a new full MySQL `query_block` parser.

Initial provider metadata is obtained without connecting and may still advertise JSON.
The query response's `explainFormat` identifies what the server actually selected.
See the [EXPLAIN API contract](../API_DOCS.md#structured-explain-requests) for the
request shape, single-statement limits and errors. Protocol/compatibility measurements
elsewhere in this document remain dated observations, not fresh fallback validation.

### Labels

MySQL keeps the default SQL `getLabels()` from `BaseDatabaseProvider` (entity → *Table*, *Select Top
50*, etc.) for everything a person clicks. `analyzeAction` is one of them and is correct: MySQL runs
`ANALYZE TABLE`. The vacuum slot is not, and is overridden.

**The vacuum slot** ([mysql.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)): `vacuumAction` →
*"Optimize Table"*, `vacuumGlobalLabel` → *"Run Optimize"*, `vacuumGlobalTitle` → *"Optimize
Tables"*, `vacuumGlobalDesc` → the OPTIMIZE TABLE sentence, and `vacuumActionOperation` →
`optimize`. MySQL has no `VACUUM`, so the base default put *"Vacuum Table"* in the explorer's row
menu and *"Run Vacuum" / "Reclaim Space"* on the admin Operations tab for an engine whose operations
are analyze/optimize/check/kill — and because that card was gated on the literal `vacuum`, no
wording MySQL could have declared would have been shown (#U9,
[§9](#where-each-operation-may-be-offered-maintenanceoperationspecs)).

**And one monitoring field** ([mysql.ts:346](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/mysql.ts)):
`slowQueriesEmptyState` → *"Query stats come from
performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest - enable the Performance Schema to see them."*
The monitoring Queries panel's empty state was hardcoded to PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` advice
on every engine (#463) — an extension MySQL does not have under any name, while the
digest table this provider actually reads ([§8](#8-monitoring--health)) is a server switch a DBA can
act on.

## 11. Error handling

Native `mysql2` errors are mapped by the shared `mapDatabaseError()`
([errors.ts](../../src/lib/db/errors.ts)). What reliably maps for MySQL:

| Situation | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| Missing `host`/`database` (no connection string) | `DatabaseConfigError` |
| Operation before `connect()` | `DatabaseConfigError` (via `ensureConnected()`) |
| `connect()` fails | `ConnectionError` (carries host/port) |
| Access denied (`ER_ACCESS_DENIED`, message contains *access denied*) | `AuthenticationError` |
| Connection refused / DNS (`ECONNREFUSED`, `getaddrinfo`) | `ConnectionError` |
| Killed query (*"Query execution was interrupted"*) | `QueryCancelledError` |
| Driver message contains *timeout* / *timed out* (e.g. `Lock wait timeout exceeded`, connection-acquire timeout) | `TimeoutError` |
| Other server errors (most `ER_*` codes) | `QueryError` / `DatabaseError` carrying the original message |

> The mapper is **text-heuristic**, so MySQL `ER_*` codes that don't match a known phrase fall
> through to a generic `QueryError`/`DatabaseError` with the driver's message preserved. Note the
> nuance on timeouts: a driver error whose message contains *timeout*/*timed out* **does** map to
> `TimeoutError` (the mapping is provider-agnostic). What MySQL lacks is a **server-side query
> timeout derived from `queryTimeout`** — the provider never configures one
> ([§3.5](#35-no-server-side-query-timeout)), so it won't auto-kill a long-running query on its own.

## 12. Testing

### 12.1 How the tests work

Integration tests live in
[`tests/integration/db/mysql-provider.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/db/mysql-provider.test.ts).
The `mysql2/promise` module is replaced with an in-process mock via `mock.module('mysql2/promise', …)`
**before** the provider is imported — there is no live MySQL in the suite. The mock's pool/connection
returns canned `[rows, fields]` tuples, exercising the same provider code paths as a real server.

Three mock shapes are load-bearing. A non-SELECT must be mocked as a **`ResultSetHeader` object with
`undefined` fields**, not as an array. An array-shaped mock is exactly what hid the
`result.rows.map is not a function` defect described in [§5.1](#51-execution) — the whole suite was
green while every DDL and DML statement failed against a real server.

A mock must also refuse what a server refuses, and **every** fixture must, not just the one written
for the defect. The default mock used to answer ANY statement over
`performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest` with an invented `query`/`calls`/`avgTime`
row, which is how the broken health statement in
[§8](#the-slow-query-line-asked-for-a-column-the-digest-table-does-not-have) stayed green for as long
as it existed: it asked for a column no MySQL-family server has, and only the mock ever answered it.
About a hundred of the tests in the file run against that fixture, so the unfaithfulness was the
default condition of the suite rather than a gap in one test.

`sqlTextRefusal()` is the corrective, and all three digest fixtures answer with it —
`defaultMockExecute`, `perfSchemaDisabledMockExecute` and `digestTableMockExecute` — rejecting any
statement that names `sql_text` with the real `ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR` (1054, `42S22`, re-verified
2026-08-27 against `libredb-mysql`) and otherwise returning the digest columns a server returns. The
OFF fixture is the one that shows why it has to be all three: while it answered `[[], []]` to the
broken statement too, *both* readings produced `[]`, so "the health line is empty on a server whose
Performance Schema is off" passed with the fix reverted — it modelled a server that does not exist.
On top of that, one test asserts independently of any fixture's kindness that no `getHealth()` read
names `sql_text` at all, and one reads the statement the health call issued to pin its `LIMIT 5` and
the absence of a slowness predicate.

That corrective was still unpinned, though, and said so: reverting `defaultMockExecute` to its
unfaithful shape left the suite at 111 pass / 0 fail, because every test that needs the refusal
installs a dedicated fixture. So the rule now lives where no fixture can opt out of it.
`UNANSWERABLE_STATEMENTS` is a list of statements no MySQL-family server accepts — one entry today,
the `sql_text` digest read, and each entry has to be a *measured* refusal, because a rule that
refuses what a server answers is the same defect with its sign flipped. It is evaluated in
`recordCall`, the one funnel every fixture in the file goes through (named, delegating and inline
alike). The match is a co-occurrence over the whole statement, which is wider than the measurement:
a join of the digest table against `events_statements_current` — which *does* have `SQL_TEXT` —
would trip it too. Nothing `mysql.ts` emits has that shape, so the over-match is recorded next to
the rule rather than paid for; the day a statement does, the rule narrows rather than gaining an
exception. A fixture that *answers* a listed statement is **recorded** rather than thrown at: a
throw from there would arrive inside `getHealth()`'s per-panel catch as a panel error the test under
way might legitimately be asserting, which is exactly where the original unfaithfulness did its
damage. A file-scope `afterEach` — file scope because the file has five top-level `describe`s, and a
hook inside one would leave four unguarded — drains the recorded violations and fails the single
test that produced one.

Because `mysql.ts` no longer emits any statement naming `sql_text`, nothing else in the suite can
make that rule fire, so a `describe` at the end of the file drives it directly: one test installs an
unfaithful fixture and asserts the violation is recorded, and one installs the shared fixture and
asserts it *rejects* — which pins `defaultMockExecute`'s fidelity (deleting its refusal branch now
fails that test by name **and** the file-scope hook) and simultaneously proves the guard's `.then`
wrapper leaves a rejection a rejection.

Its reach is exactly the rules it carries, and only over statements a test actually sends. Deleting
`perfSchemaDisabledMockExecute`'s refusal branch, for instance, is **not** caught today: no test
installs that fixture *and* sends a `sql_text` statement, so nothing asks it the question. The guard
closes the door on a fixture that lies when asked; it does not interrogate fixtures nobody asks.
The list stays in this file rather than in `tests/helpers/` until a second engine has a measured
refusal of its own — the other fourteen provider test files would receive an empty rule list, which
proves nothing about their fixtures and reads as coverage. That condition is recorded in the list's
own docblock, where a second engine's implementer will meet it.

And the mock connection answers **both `query` and `execute`**, recording which one each statement
went through. A mock that only answered `execute` could not tell a statement routed to the text
protocol from one left on the prepared protocol, which is what
[§3.4](#34-which-wire-protocol-a-statement-takes) turns on: the `MySQLProvider wire protocol` block
pins the method for `getHealth`, `getOverview`, `getPerformanceMetrics`, `getSchema`,
`getStorageStats`, each maintenance statement, `cancelQuery`, the editor's own path (with and without
parameters), the Explain statement `mysqlJsonStrategy` builds, and the transaction path.

> ⚠️ **Mock isolation:** `bun`'s `mock.module()` is process-wide, so files mocking different drivers
> cross-contaminate when they share a process. A **single file** is safe (one file = one process).
> The full `bun run test` script runs the core group in **one** process and is load-order flaky, so
> **CI does not use it** — the deterministic runner is **`bun run test:ci`** (per-file isolation via
> `tests/run-core.sh`); the coverage workflow uses `bun run test:coverage`. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

### 12.2 Coverage

20+ describe blocks cover: validation (incl. connection-string bypass), connect/disconnect,
capabilities, `getSchema()` (columns/FKs/indexes, primary-key detection), health, maintenance (all
types + kill validation), the full transaction lifecycle, `queryInTransaction`, query cancellation,
overview, performance metrics, slow queries, active sessions, table/index/storage stats, every SSL
branch, `prepareQuery`, error mapping (`ER_ACCESS_DENIED`, `ECONNREFUSED`), the non-SELECT envelope
(DDL, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and the transaction path) driven from real `ResultSetHeader`
literals, and the wire protocol each statement takes.

### 12.3 Run it

```bash
bun test tests/integration/db/mysql-provider.test.ts   # just this file (single process — safe)
bun run test:ci                                         # CI publish gate — per-file isolation (tests/run-core.sh)
bun run test:coverage                                   # CI coverage workflow — per-file core + components
```

### 12.4 Optional: verifying against a live MySQL

```bash
docker run --rm -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=app -p 3306:3306 mysql:8
# then point a connection at localhost:3306 (db=app, user=root) in the Studio UI
```

---

## 13. Usage examples

```ts
import { createDatabaseProvider } from '@/lib/db/factory';

const provider = await createDatabaseProvider({
  id: 'my1', name: 'App', type: 'mysql',
  host: 'localhost', port: 3306, database: 'app',
  user: 'root', password: 'secret', createdAt: new Date(),
});

await provider.connect();
const res = await provider.query('SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE active = ?', [1]);
const schema = await provider.getSchema();   // single call (no two-phase split)
await provider.disconnect();
```

Over the API: `POST /api/db/query`, `POST /api/db/transaction`, `POST /api/db/cancel`,
`POST /api/db/maintenance` (admin), and `POST /api/db/schema/list` (falls back to `getSchema()`).

## 14. Known limitations & future work

- **No server-side query timeout.** The pool ignores `queryTimeout`; a runaway query is not
  auto-killed (only explicit `cancelQuery()`/`KILL QUERY`). *Future:* derive a per-statement
  `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` (the SELECT execution limit) from `queryTimeout`. (Note `wait_timeout` is
  unrelated — it bounds idle connections, not query execution.)
- **N+1 schema introspection, no two-phase loading.** `getSchema()` issues `1 + 3×tables` queries
  and there is no `getSchemaList()`/`getSchemaRelations()`, so large schemas are slower than the
  Postgres MATERIALIZED-CTE path and the tree cannot stream relationships in.
- **Pool tuning is limited** to `max` (`connectionLimit`); `min`/`idleTimeout`/`acquireTimeout` are
  ignored.
- **Index `scans` is `CARDINALITY`**, an estimate of distinct values — not a real index-usage/scan
  counter (MySQL has no `pg_stat_user_indexes.idx_scan` equivalent).
- **Row counts (`TABLE_ROWS`) are engine estimates** for InnoDB, not exact counts.
- **Table bloat is estimated from `DATA_FREE`** (free space), an approximation.
- **`getPerformanceMetrics()` reports nothing when `performance_schema` is off.** The panels show
  the metrics as unmeasured rather than inventing values for them, which is correct but means a
  MariaDB server (see below) has no cache-hit, QPS or buffer-pool reading until it is started with
  `performance_schema=ON`.
- **`cancelQuery()` returns `true` on `KILL QUERY` success** without confirming the target was
  actually executing.
- **Cloud SSL auto-detect uses `rejectUnauthorized: false`** — encrypted but **not** authenticated
  (MITM-exposed). For verified TLS, set an explicit `connection.ssl` with mode `verify-system` (nothing
  to paste) or `verify-ca`/`verify-full`
  and a `caCert`.
